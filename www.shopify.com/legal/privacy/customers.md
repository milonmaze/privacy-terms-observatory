Privacy for Customers

For customers that shop at Shopify-powered stores

Introduction

Shopify provides software used by our merchants to run their businesses. If you have visited or made a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, we collect and use information about you on behalf of that particular merchant. We only use this information at the direction of our merchants—they ultimately choose how and why to use your information. If you have questions about how a specific merchant or store uses your information, please visit their privacy policy.

However, if you use one of our apps (like Shop), or if you use Shop Pay to store your personal information for easy checkout across Shopify-powered stores, visit our App Information page for details about how we collect and use information from those apps and services. Additionally, please review our overall privacy policy that applies to everyone whose information we process.

What information we collect about you and why

Please note that Shopify will never use your personal information to independently market or advertise to you, unless you are using one of our apps or services directly.

What we collect	How we use it


Information you provide about yourself like your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, phone number, and payment information.

	
To provide merchants with our services, and enable them to operate their business—e.g., to allow them to complete a transaction, screen orders for fraud and risk, fulfill orders, and contact you with new products or offers



Information about how you access our websites, your account, and our platform, including information about the device and browser you use, your network connection, your IP address, and details about how you browse through our websites and platform. We collect some of this information by using “cookies” or other similar technologies directly from your device. For more information about how we use these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.

	
To provide merchants with our services, and enable them to operate their business (e.g., to provide them with analytics about how many people visit their store, and to help them troubleshoot and improve their store)
When and why we share your information with others

We use service providers to help us provide services to our merchants. Outside of these service providers, we will only share your information if we are legally required to do so (for example, if we receive a legally binding court order or subpoena), or where a Shopify merchant instructs us to share information on their behalf. If you have questions about how a merchant or store shares your personal information, you should contact the merchant or visit their privacy policy.

Your rights over your information

When you visit or make a purchase from a merchant’s Shopify-powered store, the merchant you're visiting or buying from legally controls your information. As a result, Shopify doesn’t, for example, decide how long your information is retained because that decision is made by the merchant. This means Shopify can't help you access, correct, erase, or port your information without being directed to by the merchant. To make a request about your personal information, contact the specific merchant directly. If you make a request to us, we will forward your request to the relevant merchant and help them fulfill your request. If the merchant no longer exists, however, we may be able to assist you directly. We also do not and will not “sell” your customers’ information, as that term is used in California law.
