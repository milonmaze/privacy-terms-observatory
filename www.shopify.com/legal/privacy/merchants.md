Privacy for Merchants

For merchants using Shopify to power their stores

Introduction

If you are a merchant using Shopify to power your business, or a Supplier or Retailer participating in Handshake, we collect and use your personal information to provide you with the use of our platform and its services, and generally to help you better manage your business and your relationship with your customers. Additionally, please review our overall privacy policy that applies to everyone whose information we process.

What information we collect about you and why

We collect personal information when you sign up for Shopify, when you use our platform, or when you otherwise provide us information. We may also use third party service providers (like Sift), for example to help us review accounts for fraud or other concerns. In general we need information about you for you to be able to use our platform. We process your personal data in order to perform our contract with you or because it is in our legitimate interests to maintain our business relationship, prevent risk and fraud, provide effective services to you, improve our products and services, and to be responsive to you. In some cases, we only process your personal information with your consent.

We also work with companies that provide us with information about merchants or prospective merchants (for example, to protect against fraud or if we’re sponsoring an event).

When and why we share your information with others

Running a business is hard, and we work with a variety of companies to help us provide you with a range of services to help you support your business. We sometimes share your personal information with these companies to help us provide you with Shopify services.

We also share your personal information with others:

to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, threats to physical safety, illegal activity, or violations of a contract (like our Terms of Service) or our policies (like our Acceptable Use Policy)
to help us conduct marketing and advertising
to comply with legal requirements, or to respond to court orders, or other similar government demands (for more information, please read our Government Access Policy)
in connection with an asset sale or purchase, a share sale, purchase or merger, bankruptcy, or other business transaction or re-organisation, we will share your personal data with a prospective buyer, seller, new owner, or other relevant third party as necessary while negotiating or in relation to a change of corporate control such as a restructuring, merger, or sale of our assets.

Additionally, almost every merchant using the Shopify platform also uses non-Shopify services to support their business (for example, apps from our app store, sales channels, payment gateways, or shipping providers).

Shopify doesn’t control how these services use your personal information, and you should review any other service you use to make sure it meets your privacy expectations. When you choose to use non-Shopify services, you can review what access any app has to your information or your store’s information on the “App Details” page in the Shopify admin.

Your rights over your information

You can access and correct a lot of your personal information directly through the Shopify admin. For information you are not able to access or correct directly within the Shopify admin, please submit a data subject request through our online portal. Please refer to our Overall Privacy Policy for further information. Please note that some data subject rights only apply in certain circumstances, and all of these rights may be limited by law.

Your customers’ information

In order to power your business, we collect and use personal information about your customers. In general, we collect and use this personal information as directed by you, and as further described in our Data Processing Addendum. Legally speaking, we are a “data processor” and a “service provider” as these terms are used in certain applicable privacy laws, including in Europe, the UK, and the US.

Because you decide how the personal information of your customers will be used, you need to make sure your customers understand how you (and how we on your behalf) collect and process their personal information. You should do this by, at a minimum, posting a privacy policy on your store that describes the information you collect, how you use it, and who you share it with.

To help get you started with this, you can check out our privacy policy generator. Also, if you are collecting any “sensitive” personal information from your customers (for example, information about a consumer’s social security, drivers license, state identification card, or passport number; account log-in, financial account, debit or credit card numbers in combination with any required security codes or passwords; precise geolocation; health or genetic data, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership; contents of a consumer’s mail, email or text messages; or criminal offense data), you should get the affirmative, express consent from your customers to use and process this information.
