Introduction

If you are a merchant using Shopify to power your business, or a Supplier or Retailer participating in Handshake, we collect and use your personal information to provide you with the use of our platform and its services, and generally to help you better manage your business and your relationship with your customers. Additionally, please review our overall privacy policy that applies to everyone whose information we process.

What information we collect about you and why

We collect personal information when you sign up for Shopify, when you use our platform, or when you otherwise provide us information. We may also use third party service providers (like Sift) to help us review accounts for fraud or other concerns. In general we need this information for you to be able to use our platform.

What we collect	How we use it


Information you provide us about you and your business, like your name, the name of your staff or other individuals associated with your business, company name, address, email address, and phone number.

	
To provide you with the use of our platform and other related services (e.g., to confirm your identity, to contact you about issues with the platform, to invoice you)
To advertise and market products or features to you
To comply with legal requirements



Payment information you provide us, such as your credit or debit card number or your bank account number. If you use Shopify Capital, we also collect information that you may choose to make available to us about your business’s bank accounts or financial assets.

	
To charge for our services
To provide Shopify Payments
To provide Shopify Capital



Information about how you access Shopify websites, your account, and our platform, including information about the device and browser you use, your network connection, your IP address, and details about how you browse our websites and platform. We collect some of this information by using “cookies” or other similar technologies directly from your device. For more information about how we use these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.

	
To provide you use of, and to improve, our platform and other related services (e.g., identifying ways to make our platform easier to use or navigate)
To personalize the platform for you (e.g., by showing you apps in our app store that we believe may be useful to you)
To advertise and market products or features to you



If you use Shopify Payments, we collect more specific information you provide us about your business, including your business address, business type, business ID number, bank account information, date of birth (if you are an individual business owner), and in some circumstances, government-issued identification (such as your Social Security Number, Social Information Number, Employer Identification Number, or Tax Identification Number).

	
To create and manage your Shopify Payments account
To provide you with the Shopify Payments services
To conduct fraud and risk monitoring
To comply with legal requirements (such as “know your customer”, anti-money laundering, or anti-terrorism laws)
To provide tax documentation



Copies of government-issued and/or a picture of yourself holding your identification that you provide us.

	
If we need to verify your identity (e.g., to protect you against identity theft or fraud)
To verify that we are speaking with you if you contact us
To help us determine or verify account ownership
To comply with legal requirements

We also work with companies that provide us with information about merchants or prospective merchants (for example, to protect against fraud or if we’re sponsoring an event).

When and why we share your information with others

Running a business is hard, and we work with a variety of companies to help us provide you with a range of services to help you support your business. We sometimes share your personal information with these companies to help us provide you with Shopify services.

We also share your personal information with others:

to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, threats to physical safety, illegal activity, or violations of a contract (like our Terms of Service) or our policies (like our Acceptable Use Policy)
to help us conduct marketing and advertising
to comply with legal requirements, or to respond to court orders, or other similar government demands (for more information, please read our Government Access Policy)
if we merge with or are acquired by another company

Additionally, almost every merchant using the Shopify platform also uses non-Shopify services to support their business (for example, apps from our app store, sales channels, payment gateways, or shipping providers).

Shopify doesn’t control how these services use your personal information, and you should review any other service you use to make sure it meets your privacy expectations. When you choose to use non-Shopify services, we tell you what information we will share with that service at your direction, so you can decide whether you want to use the service. You can review what access any app has to your information or your store’s information on the “App Details” page in the Shopify admin.

Your rights over your information

We believe that you should be able to access and control your own personal information no matter where you live. You can access and correct a lot of your personal information directly through the Shopify admin. For information you are not able to access or correct directly within the Shopify admin, please submit a data subject request through our online portal.

Because we need your personal information to provide Shopify services, we generally keep your personal information while you use Shopify products or services. If you close your store, you stop paying your subscription fees, or we terminate your account, we retain store information for two years before we begin the personal information purge process. We don’t do this immediately in case you reactivate your account, or if there is a legal complaint or audit relating to your business. If you contact us to request deletion of your store’s information, we will begin the personal information purge process after 90 days, except if we are legally required to retain specific information. If you have questions about this process, please contact our Support team. Please keep in mind that after we anonymize your personal information, we may continue to use non-identifiable information to improve our services.

Finally, we do not and will not “sell” your personal information, as that term is used in California law.

Your customers’ information

In order to power your business, we collect and use personal information about your customers. In general, we only collect and use this personal information as directed by you, and as further described in our Data Processing Addendum. Legally speaking, we are a “data processor” and a “service provider” as these terms are used in European and California privacy law. We will never use your customers’ information to independently market or advertise to your customers unless they are also using one of our applications or services directly. We also do not and will not “sell” your customers’ information, as that term is used in California law.

Because you decide how the personal information of your customers will be used, you need to make sure your customers understand how you (and how we on your behalf) collect and process their personal information. You should do this by, at a minimum, posting a privacy policy on your store that describes the information you collect, how you use it, and who you share it with.

To help get you started with this, you can check out our privacy policy generator. Also, if you are collecting any “sensitive” personal information from your customers (for example, information about health, race, ethnicity, genetics, biometrics, trade union membership, political opinions, philosophical or religious beliefs, criminal history, or sexual interests), you should get the affirmative, express consent from your customers to use and process this information.
