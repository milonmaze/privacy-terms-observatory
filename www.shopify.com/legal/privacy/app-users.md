Provide, Improve, and Customize Shopify Services: To provide customized Shopify services to you, including by displaying your purchase history and order status in one place, providing easy payment options when you shop, recommending products, Merchants and Shop(s) and customizing the products featured for you, and to improve Shopify services, including based on your use of Shopify Consumer Services and activity with our Merchant(s).

Shopify may also aggregate, de-identify, and/or anonymize any information collected through the Shopify services in such a way that we cannot reasonably link information to you or your device. We may use such aggregate, de-identified, or anonymous information for any purpose, including, for example, to improve the Shopify service.

4. How We Process Your Personal Data on Behalf of Shopify Merchants

Shopify also processes your Personal Data from Merchants you interact or shop with in order to help Merchants run their Shop(s) and to provide business services to our Merchants. When Shopify processes Personal Data in this way, we are acting at the direction of the Merchant, and the Merchants' terms of service and privacy policy apply—not Shopify's. For more information about how Merchants collect and use personal information when you visit and make purchases in their Shop(s), review the Merchant's terms and privacy policy.

In addition, some Merchants may instruct us to use Personal Data they share with us for targeted advertising for these and other Merchants using these services on third-party sites. You may have the ability to opt out of allowing a Merchant to share your information with us for these purposes directly on that Merchant's site, such as through the Global Privacy Control. We also offer you choices about how Shopify uses personal information merchants share with us for ad services here.

5. Third-Parties Who May Receive Personal Data

Depending on which Shopify services you use or interact with, Shopify may provide Personal Data to the following categories of third parties:

Vendors: Shopify works with third-party service providers to provide, support, and improve Shopify services and technical infrastructure, for business services such as payment processing, including in relation to purchases made when you use Shopify Services, and for marketing and business analytics.
Marketing, Advertising, and Analytics Partners: We may use third-party marketing, advertising, and business analytics partners to deliver personalized advertising and to help us understand how people use or interact with Shopify services and our Merchants. These partners may receive information about your use of, or interactions with, Shopify services, including through third-party cookies or other technologies. For example, we may make information available to third-party advertising companies to serve you with relevant ads or content and to manage, improve and measure our advertising campaigns. Providing information to third parties for personalized advertising services may be considered “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising, or “targeted advertising,” as defined by applicable law. You may opt-out of our sharing of Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising by using the relevant settings available here. Please see Your Privacy Rights and Choices below for additional information.
Change of Control: We may share Personal Data with actual or prospective acquirers, their representatives and other relevant participants in, or during negotiations of, any sale, merger, acquisition, restructuring, or change in control involving all or a portion of Shopify's business or assets, including in connection with bankruptcy or similar proceedings.
Legal Reasons: We may share Personal Data as needed to: (1) comply with applicable law or respond to, investigate, or participate in valid legal process and proceedings, including from law enforcement or government agencies; (2) enforce or investigate potential violations of its Terms of Service or policies; (3) detect, prevent, or investigate potential fraud, abuse, or safety and security concerns, including threats to the public; (4) meet our corporate and social responsibility commitments; (5) protect our and our Merchants and users' rights and property; and (6) resolve disputes and enforce agreements.
Sharing at Your Discretion: Where you provide consent, we share your information as described at the time of consent, such as when connecting with a third party application or website.
6. Third Party Partners & Integrations

Parts of Shopify services may link to third party services. Shopify doesn't own or control these third parties. When you interact with these third parties and choose to use their services, your use is subject to the privacy policies of those providers.
