Introduction

Shopify offers a range of apps and services meant to make it easier for you to buy things online and track your orders. For example, we offer Shop to help you track purchases you have made online, and Shop Pay to help you quickly complete a transaction on Shopify-powered stores. When you use these apps, or if you use any of our free business tools, we use your personal information to provide you with and improve the specific service you are using. Additionally, please review our overall privacy policy that applies to everyone whose information Shopify processes.

What information we collect about you and why

Shopify collects the following personal information about you when you use one of our apps:

To provide you with - and improve - the app or service you are trying to use (e.g., to confirm your identity, to contact you about our products or services, to complete transactions)
To pre-fill order information if you are trying to checkout through a Shopify-powered store
To provide you with recommendations of other stores near the addresses you provide
To advertise and market Shopify services or features to you
To determine if you are eligible for specific offers or payment methods
To comply with legal requirements

To determine if you are eligible for specific offers or payment methods



If using Shop: Information from email messages in the email inboxes that you connect to your Shop account, and information from email messages you transfer to the app to be included in your order history.

	
In order to provide services through Shop (and improve the product), we use automated software to identify shopping-related emails in Gmail or Outlook inboxes that you connect to Shop so that we can display within the app information about specific orders you have made, stores you have engaged with in the past, and other related information. Note that by connecting email inboxes or transferring emails to Shop, no humans will have access to the content of your email messages unless you specifically allow this type of access.
To personalize your experience using our apps and services (e.g., by changing how we may order items that we show you)
In order to access these emails, an independent third party auditor has taken a look at how Shop uses and protects your email information, and has confirmed that we meet Google’s standards. Shop’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google Accounts will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
If you connect your Outlook account, you can revoke Shop’s access at any time by visiting https://account.live.com/consent/Manage and/or https://myapps.microsoft.com
We do NOT use this information to provide you with marketing or advertising from other stores or services

When and why we share your information with others

When you use Shop or another Shopify app to make a purchase, we share your personal information with the specific merchant from whom you make the purchase. We also rely on a number of service providers, including our subprocessors, to help us provide you with our services, which often requires us to share personal information. We also share your personal information with others:

to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, threats to physical safety, illegal activity, or violations of a contract (like our Terms of Service) or our policies (like our Acceptable Use Policy)

to help us conduct marketing and advertising (although if you use Shop we DO NOT share information from your connected email account or from purchases you have made through Shopify stores to help us market or advertise to you)

to comply with legal requirements, or to respond to court orders or other similar government demands (for more information, please read our Government Access Policy)

if we merge with or are acquired by another company

Your rights over your information

We believe that you should have the right to access and control your own personal information no matter where you live. We generally retain your personal information until you stop using the app in question and inform us that you would like your personal information to be deleted. If you would like to access or request that we delete your personal information, and you use any of the below services, please follow the instructions below:

If you use Shop or Shop Pay: Please visit https://shop.app/opt-out for instructions on how to request deletion of your information. To make a request to access your information or another type of request, please submit a data subject request through our online portal

If you receive newsletters or marketing from us: please click ‘Unsubscribe’ from the bottom of those emails

For all other services, please submit a data subject request through our online portal

Please keep in mind that after we anonymize your information, we will continue to use aggregated non-identifiable information to improve our services.

Finally, we do not and will not “sell” your personal information, as that term is used in California law.
