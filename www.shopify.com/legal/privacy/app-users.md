Privacy for Users of Shopify Apps

For users of Shopify’s apps, customer-facing services, or free business tools

Introduction

Shopify offers a range of apps and services meant to make it easier for you to buy things online and track your orders. For example, we offer Shop to help you track purchases you have made online, and Shop Pay to help you quickly complete a transaction on Shopify-powered stores. When you use these apps, or if you use any of our free business tools, we use your personal information to provide you with and improve the specific service you are using. Additionally, please review our overall privacy policy that applies to everyone whose information Shopify processes.

Shopify collects the following personal information about you when you use one of our apps. We process your personal data in order to perform our contract with you or because it is in our legitimate interests to maintain our business relationship, prevent risk and fraud, provide effective services to you, improve our products and services, and to be responsive to you. In some cases, we only process your personal information with your consent.

In order to access these emails, an independent third party auditor has taken a look at how Shop uses and protects your email information, and has confirmed that we meet Google’s standards. Shop’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google Accounts will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

We also rely on a number of service providers, including our subprocessors, to help us provide you with our services, which often requires us to share personal information. We also share your personal information with others:
