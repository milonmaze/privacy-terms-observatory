Disclosure

In some cases, Shopify may be compelled to produce personal information to third parties. We only do so when we are required by a court order or similar legal process. When we are allowed to inform the data subject, we do. Even if we are not permitted to inform the individual, we publicly disclose the aggregate number of requests we receive here.

We have strict rules around when we will produce personal information to third parties. You can read more about those rules in our Guidelines on Legal Requests for Information

Each Transparency Report provides data on how these principles are applied in practice.

More information about data protection at Shopify can be found in our Privacy Policy.
