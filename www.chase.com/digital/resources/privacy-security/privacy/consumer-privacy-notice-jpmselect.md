What we do

How does Chase protect my personal information?	To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. We authorize our employees to get your information only when they need it to do their work, and we require companies that work for us to protect your information.
How does Chase collect my personal information?	

We collect your personal information, for example, when you

open an account or provide account information
pay your bills or pay us by check
use your credit or debit card

We also collect your personal information from others, such as credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies.


Why can't I limit all sharing?	

Federal law gives you the right to limit only

sharing for affiliates' everyday business purposes – information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing.

See below for more on your rights under state law.


What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?	Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.
