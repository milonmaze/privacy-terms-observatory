Purchase Protection Policies
I. Overview
Understanding our policies
Our Purchase Protection Policies are here to provide you with peace of mind whenever you make a purchase through on-site checkout on Facebook or Instagram. We want you to have a great experience every time, but if you have an issue with your purchase, our policies are in place to help make things right.
To qualify for Purchase Protection:
Make sure that your purchase is eligible as a protected purchase as defined in this policy.
Use on-site checkout on Facebook or Instagram to complete your payment for the purchase. Purchases made through third-party sites, local pick-ups, Messenger transactions or through other messaging services do not qualify. Learn which products have on-site checkout on Facebook and Instagram.
Contact the merchant first to let them know that there's a problem with the purchase. For eligible purchases, if you can't resolve the issue directly with the merchant, you may submit a claim through Facebook or Instagram.
We will review your claim to determine whether it qualifies for Purchase Protection, and issue a refund for the full purchase price of the item and delivery costs if your claim is approved. Decisions are made at our sole discretion.
II. Protected purchases
When are purchases protected?
Many purchases that you make using on-site checkout on Facebook or Instagram are covered by our Purchase Protection Policies. Your purchases are protected in the following situations:

An item is considered "not received" if an item is not received by the buyer within 16 days after the merchant or individual seller confirms the order.
Item damaged or significantly different than described. For example:
Item was damaged during delivery
Item is missing major parts, and this wasn't disclosed
Item condition was different than described
Item is a different version or edition than what was displayed for the purchase
Item is completely different from what was ordered
Merchant not following their stated Refund Policy
Unauthorised purchases

III. Disputes and refunds
Contacting the merchant
You should first contact the merchant to resolve your issue with a purchase. The merchant has two working days to respond to you and attempt to resolve your issue.
Filing a claim with Facebook or Instagram
If a merchant has not responded or resolved your issue after two working days, you can submit a claim for our review on the third working day.
When you file a claim, answer the questions presented and include details regarding your issue within the form. We'll review your claim, including any messages that you and the merchant sent to each other, along with supporting documentation from the buyer and the merchant. We'll typically respond within 48 hours.
Learn how to contact the merchant for help or submit a claim to Facebook or Instagram.
Refunds and returns
If you are requesting a refund, remember to contact the merchant within the return period specified in the product listing and follow the merchant's instructions for returning the delivered item.
If the merchant is unresponsive or is not following their stated Return Policy, you may still be required to provide a valid tracking number of the returned item or other proof of return to us in order to receive a Purchase Protection refund.
Limitations
You can file a claim for the full price of an item with a purchase price of up to USD 2,000 including tax and delivery. You have a lifetime coverage limit of USD 10,000.
You must file a claim within 45 days from the date of delivery of your purchased product, or within 60 days for unauthorised claims. If you never received your item, you must wait two days after the last date of estimated delivery before filing a claim.
When reporting unauthorised purchases, you should notify us immediately so that we can try to protect you from financial loss. You must submit a claim within 60 days after the charge.
You must be in compliance with our terms and policies, including the Community Payments Terms, to be eligible for Purchase Protection.
Resolving and closing cases
If we approve a buyer's claim, the buyer is refunded for the full purchase price of the item and delivery costs. Decisions on claims are made at our sole discretion.
Denied claims
Reasons why your claim could be denied under this policy include:
The item received was the same as described by the merchant in your purchase
The claim was filed due to buyer's remorse
The item was received and the merchant verified the delivery of the product
You disputed the transaction with the bank that issued your credit or debit card
You didn't submit sufficient evidence requested by Facebook to support your claim
Policy abuse
If you file fraudulent claims for purchases made on Facebook or Instagram, we may disable your ability to make payments or take additional action on your account.
