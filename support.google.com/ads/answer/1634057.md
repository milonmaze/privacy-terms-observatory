Where can you control your ads

With My Ad Center and About this Ad, you have greater control of your ad experience. Whether you're on Google services, like YouTube and Search, or on sites that partner with Google to show ads, you can block an ad, report an ad, learn who paid for an ad, and much more.

My Ad Center on ads

You can open My Ad Center directly on the ads you see on Google services, like Search and YouTube. With My Ad Center, you can:

Block an ad
Report an ad
Like an ad
Customize the ads you’ll see
Learn more about this advertiser
See what info was used to show you that ad
My Ad Center will be rolled out gradually across all Google services in 2023. You may not see all of the following features on all Google services right away.
About this Ad

You can open About this Ad directly on the ads you see on partner sites and apps. Partner sites and apps use Google technology to show ads and are neither owned nor operated by Google. With About this Ad, you can:

Block an ad
Report an ad
Learn more about this advertiser
See what info was used to show you that ad
Not every website or app uses Google technology to show ads. Many sites and apps use other ad platforms to show ads.
Block an ad

With My Ad Center and About this Ad, you can block ads you don’t want to see. After you block an ad, we’ll do our best to make sure you don’t see that same ad on Google services or partner sites while you’re signed in to your Google Account.

On Google

To block an ad on Google service, like Search and YouTube:

On the ad, select More.
Select Block ad .
On sites and apps that partner with Google

To stop seeing an ad on sites and apps that partner with Google:

On the ad, select Close.
Select Stop seeing this ad.
Report an ad

Keeping ads safe for users is a top priority for Google, but sometimes bad ones fall through the cracks. If you see an ad that you think violates Google’s ad policies, you can report it.

Reporting an ad does not block that ad. Learn more about how to block an ad.

To report an ad:

For ads you see on Google services, on the ad, select More.
Or
For ads you see on sites and apps that partner with Google, on the ad, select CloseWhy this ad?

Fill out the form.
If the form has any fields that are pre-filled, do not edit them.
If required, provide additional details telling us why you think this ad violates our policies.
For example, if you think an ad is phishing, provide the name of the site this ad claims to be from.
Select Submit.

Customize ad topics and brands

With My Ad Center, you can customize your ads by choosing the topics and brands that you’d like to get more or fewer ads about. By customizing your ads, you have greater control of the kinds of ads you see on Google services, like Search and YouTube.  

When you customize your ad, you are influencing how Google determines what ads to show you. If you tell Google you’d like to see more ads about hiking and see fewer ads about jewelry, you may start to see more ads related to the outdoors  and fewer ones related to necklaces.

Customizing your ads does not block ad topics or brands
Customizing your ads doesn't mean you'll see more or fewer ads overall. When you tell Google you want to see fewer ads about a topic or brand, you’ll start to see fewer ads about that topic or brand soon. In some instances, however, you still might see an ad about that topic or brand. For example, if you wanted to see fewer ads about jewelry, but use Google Search to look for earrings, you may see ads for earrings.
On Google

You can customize your ads in My Ad Center and on ads you see on Google services. To customize your ads, when you see an ad on Google:

On the ad, select More.
Select See more  or See fewer  on the topics or brands you want to see more or fewer ads about.

This feature isn’t available if you’ve turned personalized ads off or are signed out of your Google Account.
