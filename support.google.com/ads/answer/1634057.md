Google can personalize ads so they're more useful to you.

Personalized ads aren't shown or hidden from you based on sensitive categories, like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.

Types of ads you might see
Ads on Google services: You might see ads with results on Google Search, or before you watch a video on YouTube.
Ads on non-Google websites and apps: Non-Google websites and apps (like a newspaper's website or a gaming app) that show ads from Google.
How Google works with advertisers

Ads are necessary for many websites to provide free services or information. Ads also help keep many Google services free.

As an ad network, Google connects:

People who own websites with ad space
People who want to promote a product
People who think the product is interesting

Google doesn't sell your personal info to anyone, and doesn't let anyone read your emails to show you ads.

Websites that host ads can only see info that you ask Google to share.
Advertisers can only see how well their ads are performing.
