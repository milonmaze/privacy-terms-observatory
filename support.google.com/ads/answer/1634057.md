Control your ad experience

My Ad Center and About this Ad give you more control of your ad experience by letting you give feedback on the types of ads you want to be shown. Whether you're on Google services or on sites that partner with Google to show ads, you can block an ad, report an ad, learn who paid for an ad, and much more.

My Ad Center works best in the newest version of your browser. If you’re using an outdated version, you may not be able to use My Ad Center. Learn more about how to Update Google Chrome.

Some features of My Ad Center may not be available if you’ve turned off personalized ads or if you’re signed out of your Google Account. Learn more about How personalized ads work.

Customize ad topics and brands

My Ad Center gives you more control of the kind of ads you're shown on Google services by letting you choose the topics you’d like to be shown more or fewer ads about. Customizing your ads doesn't mean you'll be shown more or fewer ads overall, but giving feedback on your ad preferences helps Google determine what ads to show you based on your interests.

Customizing your ads doesn’t block ad topics or brands. When you tell Google you want to be shown fewer ads about a topic or brand, you’ll get fewer ads about that topic or brand soon. In some cases, your browsing data can affect the preferences you set in My Ad Center. For example, if you select that you want to see fewer ads about jewelry in My Ad Center but you search for “earrings” using Google Search, you may be shown related ads about earrings based on this search.

Customize ad topics and brands in My Ad Center

You can use the Customize Ads page in My Ad Center to choose topics and brands that you want to be shown more or fewer ads about on Google services. You can also set your preferences for ads about sensitive topics.

On the Topics tab, you can filter and sort popular topics and opt to get more or fewer ads about those topics.
On the Brands tab, you can filter and sort popular brands and opt to get more or fewer ads about those brands.
On the Sensitive tab, you can limit ads about sensitive topics like Alcohol, Gambling, Weight loss, and more.
