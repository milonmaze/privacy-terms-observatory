5. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

"Cookies” are small text files that may be placed on your browser when you visit websites. When you quit your browser, some Cookies are stored in your computer’s memory, while some expire or disappear.

“Web Beacons,” also known as Internet tags, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are a type of technology placed on a webpage or in an email.

We and our Vendors use Cookies, Web Beacons, session replay, device advertising IDs and similar technologies on the Services for a number of business purposes, such as to monitor our advertising, remember your preferences, personalize your experience, understand how you use and interact with the Services, suggest products tailored to you, for security purposes, to improve the Services and for marketing campaign performance. These technologies collect information about your browser/device and your use of the Services, such as the time/date of access and time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, whether you open our emails, and other traffic data.

You may be able to configure your web browser to decline Cookies and/or configure your email client to not load Web Beacons in emails. Please note that, if you choose to decline Cookies, certain features of the Services may not function properly or may not be accessible to you.

Please see the “Interest-Based Advertising” and “Do Not Track” sections below for information on the choices we provide you regarding Cookies, Web Beacons, and other tracking technologies.

Interest-Based Advertising

Interest-based advertising refers to collecting information about your online activities over time and across different websites, devices, and other online services to deliver advertisements based on online activity. We use interest-based advertising to deliver advertisements and other targeted content to you, including through third-party advertising partners which we may permit to track your visits to the Services using the technologies described above. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.


We, and many of the third-party advertising partners that place tracking tools on the Services, are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information on our websites by visiting our opt-out page and the websites for the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance. Users of our mobile applications may install the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices mobile app, available here, and choose to opt out of participating advertising networks’ use of mobile app activity for interest-based advertising purposes.

If you choose to opt out via the web-based tools, a Cookie will be placed on your browser indicating your decision. This Cookie is specific to a particular device and browser, so if you use different browsers or devices, you will need to opt out on each. In addition, because the opt-out is facilitated via Cookies, if you clear your Cookies you will need to opt out again. Likewise, mobile app opt-outs via AppChoices are based on your mobile device’s advertising identifier, so if you reset it, you will need to opt out again via AppChoices.

Do Not Track

We do not respond to the “Do Not Track” browser-based signal. However, our websites are designed to support the Global Privacy Control, described at https://globalprivacycontrol.org/, which you can enable by downloading a participating browser or browser extension.


6. Additional Technology

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), on the Services. Google Analytics uses Cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Services, compile reports on the Services’ activity and provide other services related to Services’ activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor and any referring website. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies. To learn more about Google’s partner services and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google, click https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.


7. How We Protect Information

We take the security of personal information, including U.S. Social Security numbers, seriously and work to limit access to personal information to authorized employees, agents, contractors, or vendors. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the information against loss, misuse, damage or modification and unauthorized access or disclosure while in our possession.

8. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We encourage security professionals to practice responsible disclosure and let us know right away if a vulnerability is discovered with our Services. We will investigate all legitimate reports and follow up if more details are required. Goldman Sachs has engaged with HackerOne to manage all submissions. You can submit vulnerability reports at https://hackerone.com/goldmansachs.

9. Retention of Personal Information

We retain personal information for varying time periods depending on our relationship with you and the status of that relationship. When determining how long to keep personal information, we take into account our legal and regulatory obligations and our legitimate business interests (such as, managing the Services, preventing fraud, responding to regulatory or supervisory inquiries, and establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims, disputes or complaints).

10. California Residents

California residents should be aware that this section does not apply to:

Personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing regulations, the California Financial Information Privacy Act, and the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994; or
Other information subject to a CCPA exception

In the past 12 months, we may have disclosed each category of personal information listed in the “What Personal Information We Collect and Generate” section to one or more of the categories of recipients listed in the “To Whom We Disclose Personal Information” section for the business purposes listed in the “How We Use Personal Information” section.

We may create, maintain and use deidentified information of California residents, and if we do, we will not attempt to reidentify that information unless permitted by California law.

Your Rights

California residents have certain rights in relation to their personal information pursuant to the CCPA. These include the right to:


Information about the personal information that we collect about you and the manner in which we use, process and disclose that information;


Obtain the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you;


Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you;


Delete certain personal information that we have collected from you;


Opt out of the sale and sharing of your personal information to third parties under certain circumstances; and


Not be discriminated against as a result of exercising any of the aforementioned rights

Although we collect certain categories of sensitive personal information as described in the “What Personal Information We Collect and Generate” section, we do not use sensitive personal information in ways that the CCPA permits you to limit.

Selling and Sharing

The CCPA requires that we describe disclosures of personal information where:


We receive monetary or other valuable consideration (i.e., selling, as defined under the CCPA); or
We disclose personal information about you through our website to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., sharing, as defined under the CCPA).

We do not sell, and have not sold in the preceding 12 months, personal information to third parties.

Marcus may share, and may have shared in the preceding 12 months, personal information from the “Personal Identifiers,”  “Device and Online Identifiers and Related Information,” and “Internet, Application, and Network Activity” categories of personal information with advertising and marketing partners to facilitate the delivery and measurement of cross-context behavioral advertising.  To opt-out of sharing, please click the “Your Privacy Choices” link on the footer of the website you are visiting. Please see the “Do Not Track” section above to learn how you can use opt-out preference signals and how they are processed.

If you choose to opt out via the web-based tools, a cookie will be placed on your browser indicating your decision. This cookie is specific to a particular device and browser, so if you use different browsers or devices, you will need to opt out on each. In addition, because the opt-out is facilitated via cookies, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again.

We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Exercising Your Rights

If you would like to discuss or exercise your rights to access, delete or correct your personal information, please contact us through our CCPA Intake Form or at 1-833-971-0826. As part of submitting a request, we will ask for your name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and mailing address.


The CCPA requires that we verify the requests we receive from you when you exercise certain of the rights listed above. To verify your request, we will check the information you provide us in your request against third-party identity verification tools, as well as verify that any personal information relates to you. As part of this process, we may call you after you submit your request to verify information. You may also designate an authorized representative to exercise the rights listed above on your behalf by providing the authorized representative with power of attorney pursuant to the California Probate Code or by executing other documentation we may require, and the representative may make the request by following the instructions above. If an authorized representative submits a request on your behalf, we will contact you to verify that they represent you.

Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to control push notifications that we may send.

Do-Not-Call Policy

We do not place telemarketing calls to numbers appearing on a state or federal do-not-call list or to a number a person has requested not receive telemarketing calls made by or on behalf of us (unless permitted by applicable law, such as when you request a call). If you ask not to receive telemarketing calls from us, you will be placed on our internal do-not-call list. Any request to be placed on our internal do-not-call list will be processed within a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days. Our employees involved in our telemarketing campaigns receive training on how to use our internal do-not-call list, and how to document, process and honor requests to be placed on our internal do-not-call list. It is our policy to honor a do-not-call request for five (5) years from the time the request is made unless applicable law requires we honor it for a longer period of time. Subject to applicable law, if you communicate with us by telephone, we may monitor and may record the call.

The Services may contain links, QR Codes, and other functionality that connect with certain websites and applications not provided by us, including social media websites (“Third-Party Websites”).
