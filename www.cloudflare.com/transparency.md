CLOUDFLARE TRANSPARENCY REPORT - H1 2021

An essential part of earning and maintaining the trust of our customers is being transparent about the requests we receive from law enforcement and other governmental entities. To this end, Cloudflare publishes semi-annual updates to our Transparency Report on the requests we have received to disclose information about our customers.

OVERVIEW
REQUIRE DUE PROCESS

Any law enforcement requests that we receive must strictly adhere to the due process of law and be subject to judicial oversight. It is not Cloudflare's intent to make law enforcement's job any harder or easier.

RESPECT PRIVACY

It is Cloudflare's overriding privacy principle that any personal information you provide to us is just that: personal and private. We will not sell, rent, or give away any of your personal information without your consent. Our respect for our customers' privacy applies with equal force to commercial requests and to government or law enforcement requests.

PROVIDE NOTICE

It is our policy to notify our customers of a subpoena or other legal process requesting their customer or billing information before disclosure of information, whether that legal process comes from the government or private parties involved in civil litigation, unless legally prohibited.

SOME THINGS WE HAVE NEVER DONE

Cloudflare has never turned over our encryption or authentication keys or our customers' encryption or authentication keys to anyone.

Cloudflare has never installed any law enforcement software or equipment anywhere on our network.

Cloudflare has never provided any law enforcement organization a feed of our customers' content transiting our network.

Cloudflare has never modified customer content at the request of law enforcement or another third party.

Cloudflare has never modified the intended destination of DNS responses at the request of law enforcement or another third party.

Cloudflare has never weakened, compromised, or subverted any of its encryption at the request of law enforcement or another third party.

If Cloudflare were asked to do any of these, we would exhaust all legal remedies, in order to protect our customers from what we believe are illegal or unconstitutional requests.

BACKGROUND ON THE DATA

The data presented below covers the period from January 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021. A request received in June 2021, but not processed until July 2021 will show as both "Requests received" and "Requests in process." Also, requests for which we are waiting for a response from law enforcement before moving forward may also be reflected in "Requests in process." The total number of domains affected and the total number of accounts affected refer only to requests which have been answered.
