You will be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: the User Submission is your original work and that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Mastercard to use any and all User Submissions in any and all media now known or hereinafter invented without territorial or time limitations and without compensation, and have all necessary consents to collect, use and disclose any personally identifiable information, images or likeness contained or displayed in any and all User Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Site and this Agreement. You agree that you will not submit as part of any User Submission any material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner and the necessary consents from any individuals whose personally identifiable information is contained in such material to post the material and to grant Mastercard all of the license rights granted herein. Furthermore, you warrant and represent that you will disclose the existence of any patent registrations or pending applications held by you which relate in any way to your User Submission.

You acknowledge and agree that no confidential relationship or obligation of secrecy or confidentiality is established between you and Mastercard regarding the User Submission, despite any statement or legend to the contrary on the User Submission and any related materials

Ownership and Use of User Submissions

By making a User Submission, you understand that you are granting Mastercard a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, fully-paid, irrevocable, sublicensable, transferrable, non-exclusive license in and to the User Submission (including under copyright, patent, and trademark law), including the right to edit, change, and create derivative works, and any concepts or ideas contained in the User Submission, including the documents, artwork, statements, drawings, outlines, proofs, displays, photographs, footage, outtakes, musical scores, audio and video footage, discs, whether in print or electronic form, produced or created by you as part of the User Submission. The license you are granting to Mastercard includes the right of Mastercard and its designees to reproduce the User Submission, prepare other works using the User Submission, combine your User Submission with other works, and alter, translate, distribute copies, display, perform, license and apply for copyright registration of the transformed User Submission in the name of Mastercard throughout the world in perpetuity in any media that now exists or may exist in the future. For example, the above grant permits Mastercard and its designees to use only certain portions of your User Submission, rerecord or modify any audio tracks or visual images you provide, rewrite the User Submission, and/or incorporate other materials, either created by Mastercard or licensed from others, with your Submission. If we create other works using the User Submission, those works will be owned by us and may be used in accordance with these guidelines, and shall not be subject to your approval.

By making a User Submission, you are waiving and agreeing not to assert any copyrights or "moral" rights or claim resulting from our alteration of the Submission or any photograph(s), footage, illustrations, statements or other work contained in the Submission. You are also agreeing to appoint Mastercard as your irrevocable attorney-in-fact with respect to the User Submission, with the right to execute and deliver any documents, in your name and on your behalf, to ensure that Mastercard can use the User Submission that you are licensing in any way Mastercard sees fit to own and protect the rights in any derivative works created from your User Submission, and to have the User Submission removed from any other website or forum.

Upon request of Mastercard, you shall execute and deliver such additional instrument of license, as may be solely deemed by Mastercard, reasonably necessary to establish Mastercard's ability to use the User Submission as it sees fit and that "Moral Rights of Authors" are waived under these Terms and Conditions. Should Mastercard fail to request the said license instrument as stated, that shall not be deemed a waiver of Mastercard's rights and Mastercard may at a later time request the instrument.

Your Mastercard branded payment card relationship is with an issuing bank or financial institution, and not with Mastercard directly. Any and all questions or issues regarding your Mastercard branded payment card or cardholder account should be directed to the bank or financial institution that issued your card, and not to Mastercard. While Mastercard has a relationship with your issuing bank or financial institution, that relationship does not pertain to individual cardholders or payment card accounts.

The Mastercard Site is operated by Mastercard and its affiliates.
