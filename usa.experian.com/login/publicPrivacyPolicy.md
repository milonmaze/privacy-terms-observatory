Your children's identity information when enrolling your children in our child identity protection products such as their name, date of birth, and Social Security number;

How We Use Personal Information

We use personal information:

Depending on the information you provide and your selected products and services, your personal information is used to access and monitor information you've asked for, provide you with identity protection services and enable applications for credit or loans;
To send credit, score, identity protection and transactional alerts to the e-mail, mobile device and/or phone number you provide;

To inform you of products, services and promotions that may be of interest to you unless you have requested that we do not send you marketing and promotional communications;
To process payments for the products and services you purchase;
If applicable, to verify your children's identity and provide products and services you request on behalf of your children;
For our everyday business purposes including audits, security, detecting and preventing fraud, analysis, product improvements, research and development;
For other purposes when you provide your consent and/or we describe the purpose to you at the time it is collected. For example, when you request that we provide your information to monitor your financial accounts or when you request features that we offer from companies we partner with.

Non-personal information is any information that does not reveal who you are, doesn't identify you individually and/or is about a collective group of Site users. This includes information described under "Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Targeted Advertising" and other information that doesn't identify you including general demographic, publicly available, derived, inferred or specifically expressed information from users of the Site. This information may be used by us and shared with third parties for any purpose. However, if we combine any non-personal information with your personal information so that it reveals who you are, it will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is combined.

How We Share Personal Information

Affiliates: As a part of Experian, we share personal information with our Experian affiliates for the purposes noted in this Policy. We do not share personal information with our affiliates for their marketing purposes without your consent.

We also share personal information with non-affiliated third parties as described:

Business Partners: We share your personal information with companies that we have partnered with to offer products that may be of interest to you. We also share your information to provide you with products and services that you request.

Service Providers: We share your personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. We share information with these service providers to provide you with the products and services you request and for everyday business purposes. For example, we use service providers for billing, communicating with our customers, detecting and preventing fraud, analysis, product improvements and development and to offer products that may be of interest to you.

With Your Consent: We share your personal information with third parties who you expressly authorize, consent to, or direct us to share your information with. For example, we share information when you request products or services offered by lenders, insurance companies, and other companies that we partner with. We also share information when you ask us to access data from your financial and/or other accounts through one or more of our third parties

Legal Purposes: We share personal information with government entities and others for lawful and necessary purposes, including to respond to requests from government entities or our regulators; to comply with subpoenas, law enforcement requests, and other legal processes; to enforce our Terms and Conditions; and as necessary to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of our customers, ourselves or others.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, sale, bankruptcy or other disposition of some or all of our assets, we may share and/or transfer your personal information to an affiliate or relevant third party.

Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Targeted Advertising

By using the website, you agree to the use of technology that tracks how users interact with our Site to ensure that the website is operating properly and to optimize website functionality.

When you use our Site, we, our affiliates, our business partners and third-party service providers collect information about your devices and interactions with our Site. The types of information collected and how that information is used and/or shared depends on how you interact with our Site and, in some cases, the choices you make. A variety of tools and technologies are used to collect this information.

Information collected and the tools and technologies used for collection include:

Device Information: The Site collects information about your devices and browsers including types of operating systems, versions, preferences, settings, Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses and geolocation. If you access our Site using mobile devices, we collect information about your mobile devices including device IDs, mobile network information and geolocation. This information is used for identity verification, track users' movements on our Site, to analyze trends and gather demographic information about the Site's users as a whole.
Server Logs: Logs are used to automatically record device information as well as your interactions with our Site such as what time of day you visited. In the event of a problem with our Site, information in the logs allow us to diagnose and the resolve problem.
Cookies: Cookies are small text files sent to your browser by a website you visit. The Site collects and uses session and persistent cookies. Cookies allow companies to recognize your device and store information about your account and preferences. For example, we may use cookies to store information about pages visited on our sites, settings and preferences, or other information associated with visitors to our Site. Cookies also allow us to track internal metrics and enhance the experience users of our Site.
Pixel tags: Pixel tags (i.e., web beacons, clear GIFs, pixels, or tags) are images or small strings of code placed on websites, advertisements, or within e-mails. These technologies collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. For example, the Site gathers user activities on our Site, links that users click on and pages viewed, the URLs user came from, and e-mails opened or forwarded. This information is used for Site tracking and administration (i.e., user movements, usage, performance, and improvements), enabling you to enroll and log-in to the Site, delivering and tailor custom content, development of new products services, and fraud detection and prevention.
SDKs and Advertising IDs: We use Software Development Kits ("SDKs") to collect mobile device information and general location. The SDKs track user movements, mobile application events and user interactions. This information is used for identity verification and also helps us improve our mobile applications for our customers. We also collect and use Advertising Identifiers ("Advertising IDs") that allow us to identify your mobile device over time for advertising purposes.

Targeted Advertising: We, our affiliates, business partners and third-party service providers collect, use and share information to develop and deliver targeted online advertising. These are ads that you may see across different sites and devices over time. This information includes marketing information such as your preferences and inferences based on your interactions with the Site.

We also use service providers to help us perform advertising-related functions such as measuring the effectiveness of our ads, managing how many times you may see an ad, reporting on the performance of our ads, ensuring services are working correctly and securely, providing aggregate statistics and analytics, improving when and where you may see ads, and/or reducing ad fraud.

Choices You Have

You can use a range of tools to control information collection, use, and sharing and make choices about receiving offers of products and services. Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can signal the websites you visit, indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is no common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not operate differently in response to browser DNT signals. If you want to change your subscription options, you can do so through the membership section of your account. If you wish to cancel your subscription, please contact us.

Opt-outs:

E-mail: We may send you promotional or marketing e-mail communications containing information about other products and services offered by us or other third parties we partner with. If you no longer wish to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in e-mails that we send you or in the profile section of your account. If you opt-out, we will continue to send you credit, score, identity protection and transaction alerts via e-mail.
Push: We may send push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate push notifications and alerts at any time by deleting the app, changing your device settings or changing the push notification settings within the app.
Text: If you consent, we may communicate with you via text ("SMS") messages at the phone number you provide. You may later opt-out of receiving SMS messages by responding to any SMS with one of the following single-word commands: "STOP," "QUIT," "CANCEL," "END," or "UNSUBSCRIBE."

Controls for Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Targeted Advertising:

Cookies: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies by default. You can use your browser settings to block, decline, or reject new cookies or delete existing ones. If you choose to block, decline, reject or delete cookies, it may prevent you from taking full advantage of our Site or prevent us from recognizing your device. These actions may impact settings, preferences and if you are a subscriber, how you log into your account.
E-mail Tracking: E-mail applications have settings that allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, which will disable tracking technologies in the email messages you read.
Targeted Advertising: Experian and many other companies participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)'s WebChoices Tool, which provides a simple way to opt-out of targeted advertising. You can learn more about targeted advertising and opt-out through the DAA at http://optout.aboutads.info/. You can also enable a feature that limits the use of Advertising IDs or you can reset the Advertising ID on your mobile device. These features do not block all advertisements to your device, but they can prevent relevant advertisements from appearing.

The controls listed above rely on information stored in unique browser cookies, applications or device identifiers, so your choices will apply only to the specific browser, application or device from which you apply the controls. You will need to apply these controls separately on all of your browsers, applications and devices.

How You Can Update Your Personal Information

If you are a subscriber and the personal information that you provided to us changes, you can make corrections or updates to your information, including your email address, phone number, mailing address, credit card information or password reminder phrase, through the edit profile section of your account. You may also make updates through one of the Membership Support options listed in your account. For your protection, we may request supporting documents before making any changes or updates to your membership information. We strongly urge you to ensure that your information remains up to date.

How We Secure Your Personal Information

We have appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures and tools in place to protect your personal information against the loss, misuse and alteration of information that complies with relevant legal requirements and best practices. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card, Social Security number or login credentials) into the Site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

When you provide information through the Site, you should be aware that your information may be transmitted across the Internet and no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please notify us of the problem as soon as possible by contacting us.
