CSR governance and reporting

Empowering every person and every organization to achieve more requires careful attention to the impact of our business practices, policies, and community investments.

Our policies and practices

We work to apply the power of technology to earn and sustain the trust of the customers and partners we empower and the communities in which we live and work. This focus extends to our work to build a sustainable future where everyone has access to the benefits and opportunities that technology can bring. It’s central to our mission to empower every person and organization to achieve more, and it's why many of our employees come to work every day.

Working together with stakeholders

We know that the decisions we make affect our employees, customers, partners, shareholders, suppliers, and communities and we take their voices into account. Microsoft receives input from millions of people each year—from individual customers to policymakers and global human rights specialists. We bring outside perspectives into the company and inform our business decisions through a variety of feedback channels. We go beyond formal channels, proactively engaging with key stakeholders, advocacy groups, industry experts, CSR rating agencies, CSR-focused investors, and many others. We also share our learnings and practices thereby generating industry dialogue, informing public debate, and advancing greater progress.
