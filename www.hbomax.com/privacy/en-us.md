HBO Max Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what personal information HBO Max and WarnerMedia companies (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collect, use, share and otherwise process about individuals (“you”) interacting with us (“Information”) on our websites, applications (“apps”), services connected devices (e.g. connected TVs) and other offerings (“Offering” or “Offerings”).  

Our family of companies is made up of a number of different legal entities and business units. You can learn  more about our legal entities and business units by visiting our AFFILIATES PAGE. 

In this Privacy Policy, the Controller or Controllers  (“Controller”) of your Information means the company that decides the purposes for which it is processed and how it is processed. Which company is the Controller in relation to the processing of your Information will depend on which Offering you are using; it will often be the company responsible for providing that Offering, as may be set out in our terms of use. In some circumstances, more than one Controller may be responsible for processing your Information, for example, where Information is shared with other companies for a purpose set out in this Privacy Policy. Please navigate to our CONTROLLER LIST for more details. If you still have questions about the relevant Controller, please contact us using one of the methods set out below.

Under the laws of some countries outside the European Economic Area, we may need your consent to our processing of your Information set forth in this Privacy Policy. Subject to any indications you may give us to the contrary, such as opting out or not opting in if asked, and where permitted by law, by providing Information or otherwise interacting with our Offerings, you consent to our use of Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. It explains the types of Information we may collect about you, the purposes for and methods by which we collect it, and (where applicable) the lawful basis on which we do so, as well as information about data retention, your rights and how to contact us. This Privacy Policy covers both our online and offline data processing activities, including Information that we collect through our various Offerings such as those set out below: 

Digital Services:

Our websites, including activities run through our websites, such as surveys, research studies, focus group tests, promotions, competitions and prize-draws, purchases within our services, calls to action for user-generated content (“UGC”) and subscribing for newsletters
Mobile apps, including activities run through our apps, such as those listed for our websites
Subscription services or other streaming services offered by us to consumers and services where you receive content through our websites, mobile apps and/or via a service provided by a third party, such as an internet service provider, pay TV platform or mobile phone operator
Console games

Offline Services:

Studio tours
Attractions and exhibitions (e.g. theme parks, marketing activations at conventions or other public places, in person VR experiences)

Please note that we may combine Information that we collect via one source (e.g. a website) with Information we collect via another source (e.g. a mobile app), including with Information possibly collected by a one of our companies or a third party (as further described below). Please also note our Offline Services may involve you interacting with our Digital Services and vice-versa, for example, where you book a studio tour or your participation to a marketing event through one of our websites. Certain Offerings (for example, some branded theme parks, online stores, and in-app purchases) are not operated by us but by a third party licensee or the app store; any processing of your personal information by such a licensee or app store is not subject to this Privacy Policy, so please check carefully to determine whether the relevant terms of use refer to additional companies.

Please consult your browser's settings for more information. Note that blocking cookies or similar technology might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Digital Service features. 

Locally Stored Objects. Some of our Digital Services may use locally stored objects ("LSOs") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation, and a better user experience. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from ADOBE'S WEB SITE. Your browser may also offer other tools to delete or reject other LSOs; please check your browser's settings or help menu for more information.

Analytics and market research. Some of our Digital Services may use Google Analytics to analyze traffic. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies, including information on how to opt out of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Digital Services by visiting the relevant Google support page:  HTTPS://TOOLS.GOOGLE.COM/DLPAGE/GAOPTOUT?HL=ENWWW.GOOGLE.COM/POLICIES/PRIVACY/PARTNERS. 

Some Digital Services may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy by visiting HTTPS://WWW.NIELSEN.COM/US/EN/LEGAL/PRIVACY-STATEMENT/DIGITAL-MEASUREMENT/

Choices for direct marketing communications. You can express your preferences about receiving certain marketing communications from us. If you would like to update your marketing preferences, or limit how we use and share your data, you can (i) adjust your settings if you have created an account with us (where the feature is available) or (ii) submit a request through our INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS REQUEST PORTAL. To opt out of marketing emails, you can also follow the ’unsubscribe’ instructions provided in any marketing email you receive. 

Ad choices: Advertising on websites, apps and other devices. 

On our own or working with affiliates or third parties, we may:

Use cookies, web beacons, pixels, SDKs, or similar technologies to collect data and show advertisements on our Digital Services and on third party websites and applications over time; 
Use these same technologies for other reporting, measurement, and site analytics on our Digital Services and on third party websites and applications over time;
Get Information about applications you use, websites you visit, and other Information from across your devices and browsers and across websites, services, and apps over time, in order to help serve advertising that will be more relevant to your interests on and off our Digital Services and across your devices and browsers (‘interest-based advertising’); and  
Use this information to associate your different browsers and devices together for interest-based advertising and other purposes.

Choices for third-party activities on websites. You can get more information about interest-based advertising on your desktop or mobile browser, and you can opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, by visiting: 

If in the EEA, the YOUR ONLINE CHOICES WEBSITE hosted by the EUROPEAN INTERACTIVE DIGITAL ADVERTISING ALLIANCE (EDAA); 
If in Argentina, the ALIANZA DE PUBLICIDAD DIGITAL DE ARGENTINA (APDA);

If in the United States, the DIGITAL ADVERTISING ALLIANCE OF THE US (DAA) website. 

Important things to note about cookie-based web browser opt-outs (such as those utilized by the DAA, EDAA, APDA and DAAC):

Blocked cookies: The opt-out cookie may not work if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.
Deleting or protecting opt-outs: If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again. There are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt-out cookies. 
Only this browser: The opt-out only applies to the browser in which you set it. For example, if you set the opt-out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt-out will not be active in Chrome. To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt-out process. This is because the cookies cannot be read between different browsers or browser profiles.
The opt-out does not block or delete cookies: It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than interest-based advertising. If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities (including for research, analytics, and internal operations) and you will still see advertising. Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown. If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.

Choices for third party activities on mobile apps and devices.  To learn more about interest-based advertising on mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA’s AppChoices tool, please visit the AD CHOICE LINK to download the version of AppChoices for your device. For certain of our Digital Services, you can manage your preferences through our consent management platform. 

You may have more options depending on your mobile device and operating system. Most device operating systems (e.g., iOS for Apple devices and Android for Google and Samsung devices) provide their own instructions on how to limit or prevent use of Information to deliver personalized or interest-based advertising. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for your device’s operating system to learn more about these features and how to exercise your choices.

Choices for our targeted advertising activities. We also offer an opt-out from some of our own targeted advertising activities.  

To learn more and opt out of these targeted marketing activities on a web browser: visit HTTPS://WWW.WARNERMEDIAPRIVACY.COM/OPT-OUT.  
To opt out on a mobile or other connected device (e.g., gaming console or an app on a smart TV): use device settings as described above and we will honor opt-outs that we receive by limiting certain advertising activities on that device.

Please note that if you opt out:  

We will continue to collect data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations. 
You may continue to receive advertising on our Digital Services, such as ads based on your activities on our Digital Services. 
Your opt-out choice will apply to the browser or device where you make the choice. 

Choices for precise location information. To limit  our mobile apps’ access to precise location information from your mobile device, you can:

        (1)    Respond ‘No’ to location permission prompts that are presented during your use of our app and/or 

        (2)    Restrict the relevant device settings.

Either of these actions will also prevent third parties from collecting precise location data through our apps and will prevent our use or sharing of such information for all purposes including advertising. You may also limit the collection of precise location information from websites through browser settings.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

We operate internationally, and some of the processes involved in our use of your Information will require your Information to be stored or processed in countries outside the country where you are located, including countries where the level of legal protection for your Information may be different and where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to it or without an adequate standard of data protection regulation in accordance with your local law.

HBO MAX KIDS PROFILES

The HBO Max Platform is directed to adults only, and users must be over the age of 18 to sign-up. Please note that the word “Platform” in this section has the meaning set forth in the Terms of Use.

Adult account holders can create a Kid Profile for each child in the household to use the Platform at their own discretion. We strongly recommend that the account holder set up Kids Profiles and make use of the custom parental controls for content. The account holder must comply with any applicable obligation, taking into account a minor’s rights under applicable law. 

We have different practices for the information we collect through the HBO Max Kids Profiles than we do for the other parts of our Platform which are for adults. This section of the Privacy Policy applies to the information collected through the Kid’s Profiles.

What Information Do We Collect From Kids Profiles?

We collect only the following Information related to child users of the Kids Profiles

Profile set up information: When you set up a Kid Profile, we will ask the account holder to provide the child’s first name (or any other name for that profile that you may choose), and, if you decide to upload one, a profile photo or avatar chosen by you.
Parental control preferences:  You can exercise parental controls over your child’s use of the profile, like the kinds of shows and movies they can watch and how to require a PIN to switch between the profiles on your HBO Max account.
Technical and usage information: When a child user visits or uses the Kid Profile, we will get some information about their device and their internet browser (for example, Safari, Chrome or Firefox). We will also get some information about their IP Address, device identifiers, content searched, viewed, and added to a watchlist, and generally how they use the Kid Profile of our Platform.
When users contact us: If your child contacts us by email or using an online form, we will ask them for some information. For example, this may include their first name and email address and the reason they are contacting us. We will not use this contact information for any other purpose. Once we have completed their request, we will delete their information.

How Do We Use Information?

We use the information we collect through a Kid Profile only for the purposes described in this section or disclosed at the time of collection or for other purposes with your consent, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

Providing products and services. We use the information we collect through a Kid Profile within our Platform to provide the Kid Profile; to analyze use of our Platform; and to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve the user experience and our offerings. For example, we use information collected from a Kid Profile within our Platform to enable your child to watch trailers, movies, programs, and video clips and find other content that may interest them within the Kid Profile. 
Communicating with you and others. We use the information we collect to communicate with the account holder about the Kids Profiles or account holder requests, such as (i) to respond to your (and your child’s) inquiries and customer support requests or (ii) to contact you about your account (including your child’s activity on the account).  If we collect information to respond to a child’s request, we will not use that information for any other purpose, and we will delete the information after responding to the request. 
Use of technical and usage information. We use technical and usage information to improve the design, functionality and content of our Platform and to enable us to personalize your child’s experience with our Platform. We use this information (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our content and our Platform, products, and programs and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Platform and content, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, and (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, and (iv) for us to show offers and advertisements based on the content your child is watching at the time of the offer or ad.
