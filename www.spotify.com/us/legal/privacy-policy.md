1. About this Policy

This Policy describes how we process your personal data at USA Inc.

It applies to your use of:

all Spotify streaming services as a user. For example this includes:
your use of Spotify on any device
the personalization of your user experience - watch our personalization explainer video to learn more about this
the infrastructure required to provide our services
connection of your Spotify account with another application
both our free or paid streaming options (each a 'Service Option')
other Spotify services which include a link to this Privacy Policy. These include Spotify websites, Customer Service and the Community Site

From now on, we'll collectively call these the 'Spotify Service'.

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. They'll also be subject to this Policy, unless stated otherwise when we introduce them.

This Policy is not...

the Spotify Terms of Use, which is a separate document. The Terms of Use outline the legal contract between you and Spotify for using the Spotify Service. It also describes the rules of Spotify and your user rights
about your use of other Spotify services which have their own privacy policy. Other Spotify services include Anchor, Soundtrap, Megaphone and the Spotify Live app

We have included further information about rights and disclosures as required under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in our California Privacy Disclosures supplement.

Other resources and settings

Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls:

Privacy Center: A user-friendly hub with summaries of key topics and helpful videos. It includes the 'Your Privacy Controls' video which shows you how to exercise your user rights and make choices about the way we process your data (see Section 2 'Your personal data rights and controls' for more on user rights).
Privacy Settings: Control the processing of certain personal data, including Tailored Ads.
Notification Settings Set which marketing communications you get from Spotify.
Settings (found in the Desktop and Mobile versions of Spotify): Control certain aspects of the Spotify Service such as 'Social' or 'Explicit Content'. On the 'Social' setting, you can:
start a Private session
choose whether to share what you listen to on Spotify with your followers
choose whether to show your recently played artists on your public profile

On the 'Explicit Content' setting you can control whether explicit-rated content can be played on your Spotify account.

Cookies Policy: Information on how we use cookies and how to manage your cookie preferences. Cookies are files saved on your phone, tablet or computer when you visit a website.

2. Your personal data rights and controls

Privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), give rights to individuals over their personal data.

Some rights only apply when Spotify uses a certain 'legal basis' to process your data. We explain each legal basis, and when Spotify uses each one, in Section 4 'Our purpose for using your personal data'.

The table below explains:

your rights
circumstances when they apply (such as the legal basis required)
how to use them

You can also watch our video about Your Privacy Controls.


	It’s your right to...	How?
Be informed	Be informed of the personal data we process about you and how we process it.	We inform you:

through this Privacy Policy
through information provided to you as you use the Spotify Service
by answering your specific questions and requests when you contact us

Access	Request access to the personal data we process about you.
	To request a copy of your personal data from Spotify, either:

visit your account Privacy Settings. There, you can automatically download much of your personal data and find out how to request additional information, or
contact us to get all information we hold about you at once, without using the automatic download tool first

When you download your data you will receive the information about your data that Spotify has to provide under Article 15 of the GDPR. If you would like more information about how we process your personal data, you can contact us.
Rectification	Request that we amend or update your personal data where it’s inaccurate or incomplete.	You can edit your User Data under ‘Edit profile’ in your account or by contacting us.
Erasure	Request that we erase certain of your personal data.
For example, you can ask us to erase personal data:

that we no longer need for the purpose it was collected for
that we process based on the legal basis of consent, and you withdraw your consent
when you object (see section ‘Object’ below) and
you make a justified objection, or
you object to direct marketing

There are situations where Spotify is unable to delete your data, for example when:

it’s still necessary to process the data for the purpose we collected it for
Spotify’s interest in using the data overrides your interest in having it deleted. For example, where we need the data to protect our services from fraud
Spotify has a legal obligation to keep the data, or
Spotify needs the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if there’s an unresolved issue relating to your account
	There are several ways you can erase personal data from Spotify:

you can remove audio content from your profile by selecting the relevant content and choosing to remove it. For example, you can remove playlists from your profile, or remove a track from your playlist
to request erasure of your other personal data from Spotify, follow the steps on our support page. This data includes your User Data, Usage Data and other data listed in Section 3 ‘Personal data we collect about you’
you can also contact us directly to request erasure

Restriction	Request that we stop processing all or some of your personal data.
You can do this if:

your personal data is inaccurate
our processing is unlawful
we do not need your information for a specific purpose, or
you object to our processing and we are assessing your objection request. See section ‘Object’ below

You can request that we stop this processing temporarily or permanently.	You can exercise your right to restriction by contacting us.
Object	Object to us processing your personal data.
You can do this if:

Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of legitimate interests, or
Spotify is processing your personal data for direct marketing
	To exercise your right to object:

you can use controls on Spotify Service to switch off or adjust some features which process your personal data. For example, you can switch off ‘Tailored Ads’ in your Privacy Settings
where Spotify does not provide a control, contact us to object

Data portability	Request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service.
You can request us to transmit your data when we are processing your personal data on the legal basis of consent or performance of contract. However Spotify will try to honour any request to the extent possible.	For information about how to exercise the right to portability, please see ‘Access’ above.
Not be subject to automated decision making	Not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making (decisions without human involvement), including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.	Spotify does not carry out this type of automated decision making in the Spotify Service.
Withdrawal of consent	Withdraw your consent to us collecting or using your personal data.
You can do this if Spotify is processing your personal data on the legal basis of consent.	To withdraw your consent, you can:

adjust the relevant control on Spotify
contact us

Right to lodge a complaint	Contact the Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection or your local data protection authority about any questions or concerns.	You can find the Swedish Authority’s details here, or go to the website of your local data protection authority.

When this sharing occurs, the third party service may store a copy of it to support their features.

Personal data you may choose to share

We will only share the following personal data with those outlined in the table below:

where we need to share personal data for the use of a Spotify Service feature, or a third party application, service or device, which you have chosen to use, or
if you otherwise grant us your permission to share the personal data. For example, you can do it by selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or by giving your consent
Categories of recipients	Categories of data you can choose to share	Reason for sharing
Third party applications, services and devices you connect to your Spotify Account

You can see and remove many third party connections under ‘Apps’ in your account.

User Data
	To enable you to use the Spotify Support Community service.

See this table for details of who we share to and why.

Categories of recipients	Categories of data	Reason for sharing
Service providers	
User Data
Street Address Data
Usage Data
Voice Data
Payment and Purchase Data
Survey and Research Data
	So they can provide their services to Spotify.
These service providers include those we hire to:
give customer support
operate the technical infrastructure we need to provide the Spotify Service
assist in protecting and securing our systems and services (e.g. Google’s reCAPTCHA)
help market Spotify’s (and our partners’) products, services, events and promotions

Payment partners	
User Data
Payment and Purchase Data
	So they can process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.
Advertising partners	
User Data
Usage Data
	So they can help us deliver more relevant advertising to you on the Spotify Service, and help measure the effectiveness of ads.
For example, our ad partners help us facilitate tailored advertising.

What is tailored advertising?
This is when we use third party information to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising.
An example of a tailored ad is when an ad partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars.


How to control tailored advertising:
You can control tailored advertising in your account Privacy Settings under ‘Tailored Ads’.
You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episode’s show description. This applies where the content provider is funding their podcast by inserting either tailored advertising or content-based advertising into the podcast itself. These controls are managed by the hosting platform for the podcast, which might not be Spotify.


If you are ‘opted out’ of Tailored Ads in your Privacy Settings, you may still get advertising on ad-supported services (e.g. podcasts or the Free Service Option). Such advertising is based on your registration information and the content you are currently streaming on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.
Marketing Partners	
User Data
Usage Data
	To promote Spotify with our partners. We share certain User Data and Usage Data with these partners where necessary to:
enable you to participate in Spotify promotions, including trials or other bundled offers
to promote Spotify in media and advertising published on other online services
help us and our partners to measure the effectiveness of Spotify promotions

Examples of partners include:
marketing or sponsorship partners
websites and mobile apps who sell us advertising space on their services
device, app and mobile partners who also offer Spotify promotions

Our partners may also combine the personal data we share with them with other data they collect about you, e.g. your use of their services. We and our partners may use this information to present you with offers, promotions, or other marketing activities that we believe will be relevant to you.
Hosting Platforms	
Usage Data
	Hosting platforms host podcasts so that they can deliver them to you. We share certain data, such as your IP address, with the hosting platforms when you play a podcast. Spotify owns two hosting platforms, Megaphone and Anchor. We also allow you to stream podcasts available from other hosting platforms not owned by Spotify.

Podcast providers should explain in the show or episode description which platform is hosting the podcast. Please see the hosting platform’s own privacy policy for how they use data shared with them.
Other partner sharing	
User Data
Usage Data
Survey and Research Data
	To help us understand and improve the performance of our products and partnerships.
You can see and remove many partner connections under ‘Apps’ in your account.
Academic researchers	
User Data
Usage Data
	For activities such as statistical analysis and academic study, but only in a pseudonymised format. Pseudonymised data is where your data is identified by a code rather than your name or other information that directly identifies you.
Spotify Measurement Companies	
User Data
Usage Data
	We share data with the following Spotify companies to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns that run on the Spotify Service:
In Defense of Growth Incorporated d/b/a Podsights

Other Spotify group companies

to comply with a legal obligation
to respond to a valid legal process (such as a search warrant, court order, or subpoena)
for our own or a third party’s justifiable interest, relating to:
national security
law enforcement
litigation (a court case)
criminal investigation
protecting someone’s safety
preventing death or imminent bodily harm

Purchasers of our business	
User Data
Street Address Data
Usage Data
Voice Data
Payment and Purchase Data
Survey and Research Data
	If we were to sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or possible buyer.
In this case, we may transfer your personal data to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction.

6. Data retention

We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as:

maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service
making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings
complying with our legal obligations
resolving disputes

Criteria used to determine the retention periods include:

How can we minimize the data retention period? Our systems are designed to age out personal data in 90 days, unless another period is selected for legitimate business reasons.
Do we need to keep data to ensure the service that users expect? We keep personal data for an appropriate period to deliver a personalized service to our users over time. We typically keep streaming history for the life of an account, for example, to provide retrospective playlists that users enjoy (e.g. Your Summer Rewind and the end-of-year Wrapped campaign) and personalized recommendations based on current listening habits.
Are users able to update or delete the data themselves? Where users are able to see and update the personal data themselves, we keep the information for as long as the user chooses. For example, we keep your Spotify email address and other profile information until you choose to change or delete it yourself.
Do we need to keep the data to uphold our rules and keep our service safe? To help ensure user safety, protect against harmful content on our platform, and take action with reports of intellectual property infringement, we may keep data that has been removed from the Spotify Service for a limited period of time. This helps us investigate potential breaches of our User Guidelines and Platform Rules.
Is Spotify subject to a legal or contractual obligation to keep or delete the data? Examples include mandatory data retention laws, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation or data kept for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, we will remove unlawful content if the law requires us to do so.

7. Transfer to other countries

Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data.

Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:

make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law
help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live

Top of page ↑

8. Keeping your personal data safe

We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure.

We have implemented various safeguards to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies.

To protect your user account, we encourage you to:

use a strong password which you only use for your Spotify account
never share your password with anyone
limit access to your computer and browser
log out once you have finished using the Spotify Service on a shared device
read more detail on protecting your account

You can log out of Spotify in multiple places at once by using the 'Sign out everywhere' function on your account page.

If other individuals have access to your Spotify account (for example if you've given them permission to use your account on a shared device), then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account.

It's your responsibility to only provide individuals with permission to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalised recommendations and be included in your data download.

Top of page ↑

9. Children

Note: This Policy doesn't apply to Spotify Kids unless the Spotify Kids Privacy Policy says so. Spotify Kids is a separate Spotify application.

The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age:

is under the age of 13 years, or
makes it illegal to process their personal data, or
requires parental consent to process their personal data

We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the applicable Age Limit. If you're under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us. Instead, we recommend using a Spotify Kids account.

If you're a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us.

If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.

When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, you should be cautious about playing or recommending any content to individuals under 18 years old which could be inappropriate for them.

Top of page ↑

10. Changes to this Policy

We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.

When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.
