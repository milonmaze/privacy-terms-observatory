Do most skinny people over 30 have to think about what they eat literally all the time?

I'm a 30 year old woman and as I got to my late 20s I realized that if I want to be thin (like average/healthy thin, not super skinny, just not fat) I have to pay attention to what I eat pretty much every single day, all day long. I'm always hungry and up for eating snacks so 24/7 I have to be vigilent and make sure I'm not eating too much.

I cook nearly all my meals and it's mostly vegetarian food and limited oil/sugar, I don't drink soda ever, I never eat fast food, I eat junk food occasionally (probably once per week I make a bad decision like eating a bag of crisps), I do drink alcohol but not a crazy amount. I could easily eat like 3x the portion sizes of what I'm supposed to have for each meal, like it might be tofu and rice and veggies but I could eat a lot of it.

Is this just what it will be like for the rest of my life? I have to stay vigilent and think about what I'm eating every day 24/7 or be overweight? Are the thin people around me having to be careful with everything they eat every day and that's how they stay thin?

Edit: It would be useful to know if people responding are men or women as it might be quite different

What actor or actress did you expect would have a big career, but then disappeared?

Rooney Mara!

Going all the way back to The Social Network, she was very incredible for a character who only appears in a few scenes and really stands out in the moments she confronts Mark Zuckerberg. Then she went on to star in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which earned her an Oscar nod, and then made other appearances in movies like Her, Carol, etc. I really thought she was on her way to becoming one of Hollywoodâ€™s A-listers, but I havenâ€™t seen her in anything mainstream for a long time.

EDIT: Based on the comments Iâ€™ve been getting, Iâ€™m glad to hear that sheâ€™s still getting work. I personally havenâ€™t come across those other movies or heard of them so Iâ€™ll definitely have to check them out. Also I didnâ€™t realize she came from a filthy rich family, you learn something new every day I guess.
