What movie had you laughing, unable to breathe, even just for one scene?

I don't really pursue comedy movies too often, or ever really.

And even then, this doesn't have to be a comedy movie you respond with, but I'm wondering if there was a movie scene SO funny, that people laughed uncontrollably.

Does such a thing exist?

I think maybe the movie would have to introduce something completely original. Not a familiar gag or joke, but something completely unexpected that you can't help but be paralyzed by the newness and brilliance of the scene.

AITA for refusing to let my wife name our kid something stupid?

Me (25m) and my wife (23f) are having our first child together. She is currently 9 months pregnant and could give birth anytime in the next couple of weeks. The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.

It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn‚Äôt do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn‚Äôt want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn‚Äôt and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.

Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.

Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn‚Äôt be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better. Aita?

AITAH if I call off my engagement because of a comment my fianc√© made about my late wife?

For some background info I (43m) have 2 children with my late wife Kayla. Sam (21m) and Liz (16f). All fake names. Kayla passed away when our kids were 15 and 10. I won‚Äôt give specifics about how she passed but she was struck by a drunk driver when she was on her way home from work. She really was the love of my life and to say that her passing hit our family hard would be an understatement. I promised myself that if I got back into the dating game I wouldn‚Äôt date anyone for at least a couple years for the sake of my kids. 3 years after my wife‚Äôs passing, I met my now fianc√©. We‚Äôll call her Amanda. Things went slow and I didn‚Äôt introduce her to my kids until we had been dating for about a year at that point. Now we‚Äôve been together for 3 years and are engaged. Amanda and my kids have always had a good relationship. Neither of my kids are super close to her but they have always been friendly and welcoming to her, and Amanda has never overstepped any boundaries my kids have, like trying to replace their mother.

At the beginning of Amanda and I‚Äôs relationship, she was a bit insecure of the fact that I was a widower. During the first few months of us dating she would constantly ask things like ‚Äúif Kayla had never passed, would I still be with her right now.‚Äù I always kept my answers brief, and told her that I didn‚Äôt like thinking about the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and that she was the one I was dating now and that was what mattered. Eventually she stopped making these comments and I stopped worrying about it.

Now to the issue. My parents were hosting a family dinner to celebrate my fiance and I‚Äôs engagement. It was my mom and dad, my late wife‚Äôs sister and her husband, Sam and Liz, and me and Amanda. Dinner was going well, we were all making small talk with each other and talked about wedding plans. About half way into dinner my mom made a comment about how she was ‚Äúso happy I was able to find the spark I had with Kayla in someone else.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think anybody really paid much attention to the comment but then Amanda laughed and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy she died, otherwise I would have never gotten him to myself.‚Äù The tone of the dinner immediately shifted and everyone got extremely tense, especially my kids. Amanda noticed the shift and started awkwardly laughing like she was trying to play her comment off as a joke. I was honestly just frozen as that was the first time she had made a comment like that. My kids looked disgusted and Liz got up and walked out to the car. Sam waited a bit longer like he wanted me to say something but I was still in shock about what Amanda had said.

To make a long story about the dinner short, the dinner was kind of ruined, so I said my goodbyes to everyone, grabbed my fianc√© and we all drove home. My daughter hasn‚Äôt spoken to me or Amanda since and it‚Äôs been 3 days. I got tired of it and pulled my son aside to ask him what I should do. He said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a grown man and don‚Äôt care who another grown man marries, but I don‚Äôt want a women who speaks like that about our mother around my sister.‚Äù Sam‚Äôs comment stuck with me and now I‚Äôm considering calling off the engagement entirely. She‚Äôs never made comments like this before but I‚Äôm worried if I let it slide this one time, it will become more frequent and it will affect my daughter. I need some advice from outside perspectives and just want to do right by my kids. WIBTAH if I called of the engagement because of the comment she made?

Edit: Wow I didn‚Äôt expect to get this much advice so shortly after posting this. Nonetheless thank all of you for the advice and even the people calling me a bad father. I think your guys words are what I needed to pull my head out my ass. I will try to talk to my kids alone tonight before speaking with my fianc√© and we‚Äôll see where it goes from here. I‚Äôm pretty sure my fianc√© and I are over though. I‚Äôll update late tonight or tomorrow on how the talks with everyone goes. Thank all of you again for setting my head straight.

My wife asked me to seduce her?

My wife asked me just now to ‚Äúseduce her‚Äù tonight. She sometimes struggles with low libido and has said sometimes she just feels ‚Äústuck‚Äù and needs that extra help to get in the mood.

Any tips to help her get in the mood? I have my usual ways but tonight I want to make it a bit more special since she specifically asked ü•∞

$10.000 is a fortune

You will hear a lot of people say that it's not a big sum of money because of inflation or because it's not even worth half a year of salary in the USA. However in the bigger picture for most people in the world $10.000 is nearly live changing money.
