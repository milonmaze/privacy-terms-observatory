I left her because she made me wait for sex, AITAH?

The title spells it out alright. Me - 26 M, Her - 26 F

I've been seeing a woman for three and a half months and things were going great except for the lack of sex. Now I didn't mind this because she said she really likes being with me and is interested in building something long term and wishes to take it slow. Fine by me. But then last Friday we were making dinner at my place and having drinks and the awkward topic of our past came up. I didn't bring it up. She did. Asking about exes and whatnot. Then she admitted she hadn't dated for a while. So out of curiosity I asked how she was getting her needs met and she mentioned having friends with benefits from time to time, okay, fine, it's not serious. But then she continued and is like I can see it's bugging you before spilling her guts basically. I didn't press her. She spilled. Again, she spilled. And I just stood there awkwardly cooking and having my drink.

She starts telling me how she knows it probably bothers me that we've not had sex but she really likes me and it's been years since she was in a relationship or even felt such a connection with someone. And she's been worried I'll think she is a slu+ or something if we slept together too quickly. Then from there she goes on to talk about how she had lots of sex between her last relationship and now which is a period of nearly five years. And every time she did hook up with someone new it made her feel like she was losing a piece of the woman she was who just loved romance and wanted to be with one guy but she was young and figured she would explore now rather than dealing with such feelings later when she found a great guy.

So I asked her if they were all friends with benefits and she said no, that she had a number of one night stands from when she would go clubbing and partying, hookups from dating apps plus all the dudes she slept with more than once who she also met under those circumstances plus on social media. And she said she slept with all of them very quickly, often on the same day/night or within a couple days max.

At this point I was feeling extremely jealous, I won't lie. Because I do like her very much and we've been having a good time without having sex, but knowing that she slept with so many guys very quickly but held off because we're 'serious' annoyed me. I haven't had as many partners as she's had but I've slept with past girlfriends and friends with benefits and outside of my first girlfriend from highschool, didn't wait with any of them more than a couple weeks. I don't think there's anything off putting about me. I've been relatively successful at dating and hooking up through my teens and twenties. I guess it instantly bothered me that she was willing to sleep with all these dudes but when it's serious she wants to wait. But it's still her choice, I guess. Out of annoyed curiosity I asked if she'd slept with anyone prior to us meeting and talking which was a month before we got together. She said yes that she'd dated one dude briefly for a month and they slept together the whole time earlier this year but it wasn't serious. Then she admitted to having sex with another guy a couple times just before we got together. So during the period we were speaking but not dating.

At this point the tension is ridiculously high and she's apologizing and telling me how she's so sorry and knows I'm mad because she can see. I tell her to drop it because it's not gonna do us any good to continue the conversation. We have an awkward dinner then later that night she asks if I'd like to have sex. A day earlier it would have been an enthusiastic yes. That night? I felt like she was just guilty and trying to make me feel better. I turned her down and ended up sleeping in the spare room of my place. When she left the next day, I spent all day feeling sick. It bothered me. A lot. My mind was filled with all sorts of shit. That evening I sent her a message telling her I didn't think it will work out and explained that I just don't see anything for us down the road. I said her choices were her own and that's on her but I felt like I was being held to some unfair higher standard.

It hurt. I liked her. But I knew it would constantly be on my mind how she slept around and did so pretty quickly while I waited because things were serious. I spoke to both guy and girl friends. My guy friends pretty much agreed with me breaking it off while my girl friends disagreed and almost across the board had a stance of 'guys don't really get it, it's different when you genuinely have feelings for someone vs something casual'.

It's been a week since. I still feel sad. I've blocked her everywhere we talked. I do miss her but last Friday night still has me feeling fucked up.

So, AITAH for leaving her because of this?

Is it wrong to be proud of walking two miles?

I'm about fifty pounds overweight. Instead of driving, or calling an uber.. I walked a mile there, and a mile back. Didn't collapse, didn't get run over. I'm proud of myself, but everyone I talk to seems to treat it like it's nothing.

Is it really just chump change to walk two miles?

In Back to the Future why do we instantly buy the relationship between Marty and Doc?

Maybe this is more of a screenwriting question but itâ€™s only been fairly recently that comedians like John Mulaney and shows like Family Guy have pointed out how odd it is that thereâ€™s no backstory between the characters of Doc and Marty in Back to the Future, yet I donâ€™t know anyone who needs or cares for an explanation about how and why theyâ€™re friends. What is it about this relationship that makes us buy it instantly without explanation?
