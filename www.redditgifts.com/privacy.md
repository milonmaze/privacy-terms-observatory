AITAH if I stop seeing a woman because she used to be promiscuous?

I’ve been dating “Christine” for the past couple of weeks. We met through a mutual friend. We’re both in our mid 20’s. We’ve been on a few dates and she’s a nice person. However, on out last date, she said something to me that has stuck with me since. We were on the topic of past relationships and why they didn’t work out. I asked her how many guys has she been with prior. She said, “I honestly don’t know but I know it’s more than 20 but less than 30.” I nodded my head but inside I was taken aback. I’ve never been in a relationship or had sex before so seeing how someone can have between 20 to 30 sexual partners is crazy to me. We continued the date as planned and I drove her home. I told her I had a good time and I hope to see her again. While I’m respectful of her and her decisions, I personally don’t want to commit to a woman who has slept with that many guys. I’m aware that may come off as judgemental but I personally just cannot do it. I decided it was beat for me to tell her that I don’t think this is going to work out. She can’t go back and change her past and I’m unwilling to change my views on the matter. The other night, I left her a voicemail saying, “This is “Cedric”. The last few weeks have been great and I think you are a good person. However, I don’t think this is going to work. Sorry for the inconvenience and I hope you find what you are looking for.” She has called me twice since then but I don’t have any plans on returning her call. I don’t feel as if I owe her anything as I didn’t ghost her because I made it known I would like to stop seeing her. I would just like to find someone whose a little bit more selective in who she decides to have sex with.
