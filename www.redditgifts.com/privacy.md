What's the best game you went into completely blind , having no idea what it's about?

One aspect I miss about gaming from when I was younger was just buying games at the shop without having ever heard of them before

The best experience had to have been Fallout 3, I had 0 idea what kind of game it was, being able to choose dialogue, kill everyone (pretty much), starting as a baby then leaving the vault into this huge open world was mind blowing

New Vegas is now my favorite Fallout game but 3 will always hold a special place in my heart for this reason

Which "famous" movie franchise is pretty much dead?

The Pink Panther. It died when Peter Sellers did in 1980.

Unfortunately, somebody thought it would be a good idea to make not one, but two poor films with Steve Marin in 2006 and 2009.

And Amazon Studios announced this past April they are working on bringing back the series - with Eddie Murphy as Clouseau. smh.

Men who leave after finding out a child is not theirs are unfairly vilified

There is a kind of post I see occasionally on subreddits like AITA, AITAH, relationshipadvice, etc. that fits this basic structure:Man finds out the mother of his child/children cheated on him around the time their child was conceived, gets or wants a DNA test to find out if child is biologically his, finds out they are not, and leaves that family. There are variations of this but that's the basic premise.Every. Single. Time. that man is torn apart in the comments, saying that blood does not matter, the child is not at fault, how on earth could he leave them etc.Frankly, I think this is nonsense, through and through. The narrative of these comments always focuses on the man being horrible for leaving and that the child is his because of the time they spent together and not that he was a victim of a lying spouse that deceived him for years. And for a relevant bit of background, I was adopted as a child and I absolutely believe blood/genetics do not matter in making a family at all. But the big thing there is that for my parents, there was a choice. They made the informed decision that they would accept my as their child, it was not forced on them.Now don't get me wrong, I don't think the men in these examples are saints at all, but so often they are accused of never even caring for the kid(s) and that they must be terrible for being so ruthless. What never gets mentioned, or is at least glossed over, is that the man in question just had his whole life upended by finding out that his partner in life cheated and deceived him for possibly years on end and his life is going to be turmoil. And if this occurs in the US at least, the man is still going to be on the hook for child support even with the proof the kid is not his, meaning he doesn't even get to go restart his life if he wants to, but instead is tied to the situation where he was the victim.You can hope that the man's love for the child might break through that, but it's unfair to attack him because he isn't strong enough to overcome what was done to him. To him, that child will be the living embodiment of the mother's deception and cruelty and to ridicule someone for not wanting that to be part of their life is absurd.Lastly, for the people who say something like "I could never leave my child/I wouldn't do that!"... well good for you, but it's easy to say that sort of thing, and even if its true, that doesn't mean someone who can't handle that sort of thing is a monster.

Edit: You know someone is mad when they report you to RedditCareResources... Thank you for what I am sure is completely sincere concern, but I'm doing great.

WITAH for not impregnating my SIL?

I will keep this as short as possible. I (M35) married my wife (31) five years ago and have lived together for eight years. We had our first child 4 years ago and second child a year ago: both boys. Her sister (33) has been married for 7 years, and in that time had one child: a boy. After the birth of her child, her husband was in an accident and can no longer produce another child. My SIL and her husband approached my wife to see if I would be interested in donating my sperm in order for my SIL to give birth to one more child. My wife thought it was a great idea, and made the decision for me to proceed with the process without consulting me. I was against it at first, but I came around to the point where I was willing to speak with the fertility doctor, but I let them know I was not saying yes at this point as the whole idea still seemed weird as my kids would essentially be half siblings to this new child.

Well, after meeting with the doctor, it became very clear this was not an option as my SIL does not work and her husband only makes about 50 grand a year. They could not afford the procedure. They asked my wife and I to help offset the cost, but that was not an option I was willing to explore as I only make about 85 grand a year, and we recently purchased a new home, are trying keep invest in college funds etc. It was a hard no from me, and my wife was okay with that, but I think she would have found a way to get them some if not all the money. I told her she could put that decision on me, and she did exactly that.

Well, my SIL was upset, and she called us selfish. It turns out my SIL knew we had quite a bit of money set aside in the kids college fund as before the kids were born my wife was working, and we both put away a lot of money that we eventually turned into college funds for our kids. We have roughly 45 grand set aside, which I don't think is enough, and we keep adding to it when we can. Anyway, a couple days go bye and things seemed to have calmed down, but my SIL then asked my wife if she could essentially sleep with me in order to get pregnant. My wife was vehemently opposed to this at first but after her sister explained she wasn't attracted to me and there would be no passion but just a means to an end, my wife thought it might be a good idea. To be clear, my SIL's husband is okay with this plan. My wife I asked me to go ahead with it, but I refused. I told her they can adopt a kid out of foster care if they want another kid that bad. Now, my SIL is mad at me along with my wife as she believes this would just be a good way to help them have another child. I am standing by my decision, and I have been sleeping in the spare bedroom since my hard no, but I am starting to doubt thinking I might be being unreasonable. So, AITAH for refusing to impregnate and sleep with my SIL?

Edit one:

The money is in a joint account that requires two signatures for a withdrawal, so my wife can't take the money.

Edit two:

My SIL doesn't want to sleep with some random guy as in her mind and her husband's mind that would be cheating, but it is not cheating if it is me since I am quote unquote unattractive. I'm at work and will edit when possible but cannot possibly respond to every comment. I appreciate all the support as I felt strongly I was in the right. I won't feel guilty anymore, even if it was just a little guilty.

Edit three:

Too all the people suggesting divorce, it has never been an option for me as I love my wife, but she seems to be easily manipulated by her sister, which is nothing new. Also, it is very expensive to get divorced and would be traumatic on my young kids. I have to think about my kids well-being.

Edit four:

Maybe I should get snipped, but I haven't yet as my wife wants one more child and is hoping for a daughter.

Edit five:

My wife has always been manipulated by her sister. Their parents were much older when my wife and my SIL were born, and my SIL was supposedly always good at getting her way. When their parents died, I think my SIL was even more domineering. We moved a town over just for some space, but it hasn't helped much. I was an only child, so I don't quite understand the dynamic. I grew up pretty sheltered, but I had a good childhood and went to a good college where I was able to earn a masters in history.

Edit six:

Too all the people asking if SIL is hot. She is big as she must weigh over 250 pounds. I guess she could still be considered pretty. She is much bigger than me, however, as I weigh 150 wet. I was a cross country kid, and I've been able to stay in shape. My wife was a little over weight when we met, nothing like her sister, but she does enjoy jogging with me when time permits and has slimmed down some.

Edit Final:

My head was spinning from all the comments, and I couldn't even read half of them as this seems to have attracted a little attention. I appreciate all the support and those who understood I was doing the right thing. My sense of right has become a little warped the last few years, and I probably need to recalibrate.

Anyway, when my wife finally came home last night, she was visiting her sister with the kids, we had a talk, and it didn't go as I thought it would. I knew I was in the right, but I have a difficult time standing up to my wife as she is the first and only woman I've ever been with, and while I am not going to go into all the details of our conversation, I've come to the conclusion my wife will never be able to cut her sister out of her life, and it is clear her sister will always be in charge of that side of the family. When I made the suggestion she do that, she just started yelling and breaking things like she always does as she knows I will back down at that point. I am not sure I can live like that anymore as she has broken a lot of my stuff over the years, and I always laughed it off as my fault for upsetting her. This situation has opened my eyes. Maybe a divorce wouldn't be such a bad thing in the long run. This has given me a lot to process. I've always considered myself a nerd, my parents always told I was one jokingly, but it was true, so I've never had much when it comes to self-esteem. I've let people run over me most of my life. I've come to realize I probably need to get into therapy. Thanks again for all the support!
