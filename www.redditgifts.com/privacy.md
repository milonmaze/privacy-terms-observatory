AITAH for divorcing my wife because i found out her bodycount.
NSFW

. I (27m) have been married with my wife (28F) for 8 months now. When I married her I was told to believe we both still had our V-cards because of religious reasons. But yesterday whilst we had some friends over we talked about how young kids these days have their first time and don't really wait until marriage anymore. To which my wife responded with "Waiting till marriage doesn't make sense anyways, there are so many safe options now". I chose not to respond and just listen whilst our friend group had a discussion about it. Later that day i asked my wife if she regrets waiting until marriage to which she responded: "I didn't wait i wanted to tell u but i never felt comfortable sharing it". I have to admit then i got furious and said some things I regret saying (Namecalling etc.) and told her to leave my house (her parents live 10 minutes away). I feel like i've been manipulated and that i've been keeping to myself for nothing (we had been dating for 7 months before we married). When she returned the day after I asked her what her real body count was and she told me it was with me included 17, To which she added that most of those were only a 1 time thing and nothing felt more like real love then with me. I told her that she had a month to pack her stuff and we are getting a divorce (thankfully we signed a strong prenup that stated that in any divorce no matter the reason our assets would not be divided, she agreed because she is the only grandchild of very very rich grandparents). My friends and her family have been blowing me up saying that this is no reason to divorce since it has nothing to do with our relationship or marriage, but i disagree if i knew she didn't have her v-card i would have never married her.

Edit:

Since it was unclear; She flat out told me she was a virgin too when we started dating I told her I was waiting till marriage.

After that I didn't explicitly say I wanted a wife who was also waiting, but there was no reason too since she was a virgin anyways.

To clarify I also was upset about what my wife said about waiting till marriage, that's why I asked her about it but the topic as u can read soon changed.

I hope this will be the last edit:

The issue isn't her not being a virgin as i've stated in one of the comments. It's about her not waiting till marriage, whilst i did. If she married and divorced all 16 of those guys that'd would have been fine. (Although if u had 16 different divorces, i'd prob not be the 17th guy to marry u)

Every birth should require a mandatory Paternity Test before the father is put on the Birth Certificate
Unpopular on Reddit

When a child is born the hospital should have a mandatory paternity test before putting the father's name on the birth certificate. If a married couple have a child while together but the husband is not actually the father he should absolutely have the right to know before he signs a document that makes him legally and financially tied to that child for 18 years. If he finds out that he's not the father he can then make the active choice to stay or leave, and then the biological father would be responsible for child support.

Even if this only affects 1/1000 births, what possible reason is there not to do this? The only reason women should have for not wanting paternity tests would be that their partner doesn't trust them and are accusing them of infidelity. If it were mandatory that reason goes out the window. It's standard, legal procedure that EVERYONE would do.

The argument that "we shouldn't break up couples/families" is absolute trash. Doesn't a man's right to not be extorted or be the target of fraud matter?

What movie seems to end on a high note for the protagonists, but if you think about it they're actually pretty screwed?
Discussion

The inspiration for this question is the movie WALL-E.

The score swells with the final words of "It Only Takes a Moment," the camera pulls back showing the former occupants of the Axiom exploring their new home under the direction of Captain McCrea, and we the audience feel a surge of joy and hope for them and a recovering planet Earth... Okay great, but those humans are all excited thinking they're going to grow "pizza plants;" they have no idea the life of hardship they're entering into.
