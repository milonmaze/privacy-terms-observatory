AITAH for going to my friends IUD appointment against my husbands wishes?

So my best friend got an IUD put in last week, and unfortunately because her boyfriend was travelling for work he couldn't be there. So she asked me to come with her, partly to drive her after, partly to hold her hand and make sure she didn't freak out while they did their thing. I was happy to do that, but my husband was not.

He said that it was inappropriate to go to any medical procedure with a friend, especially one that's sex related. He wouldn't give me any reason beyond "it's just weird" and asked me not to go in the room with her. I very politely told him to get bent, she's my friend and I'm going to help her out like friends do.

Anyway the appointment went well, even if she did almost squeeze my hand off. My husband has mostly dropped the issue, but still insists that it was weird of me to do that for her. I just see it as a friend helping a friend, and I don't understand what his issue is with it, but maybe this is some boundry issue that I crossed without realizing.
