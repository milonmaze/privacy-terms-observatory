AITAH for telling my parents the only way I will let them meet my son is if they give me their dog to put down

I do not in any way want to harm my parent's dog.

When I left for university I had to leave my dog behind with my parents. I was the last kid out of the house and they liked their empty nest. To make sure it was super empty they put down my dog. She was a six year old beagle Bassett cross in perfect health. I had rescued her. I got a job to pay for her food and vet. Before I left I had quintuple checked with my parents that they were okay taking care of her while I was at school.

They were not. They told me she got out of the yard and was hit by a car. I found out the truth from my brother and I cut them out of my life. They killed my best friend.

My friend from high school had offered to take her but I didn't want to have her get attached and then have to fight to get my dog back. I honestly thought I could trust my parents.

It's been eight years since I talked to them. They were not invited to my wedding and I do not attend family gatherings where they are.

I have a three month old son now with my husband. My brother and his family were over to meet him and he asked if I'm ever going to forgive our parents. I said no.

My mom contacted me and asked what it would take for me to forgive them and let them meet their grandson. They have a French bulldog puppy. I said that if they gave me their dog so I could have it put down then I would forgive them. She said I was being ridiculous and that was not going to happen. I told her she cares more about a dog than her family which is what she always accuses me of.

My brother says I'm being an asshole. That they made a stupid mistake but that it should be forgiven. I'm never going to get over it.

The Rock is the biggest and fakest celebrity and a corporate shill. He will do anything for money and promote anything, yea he might be a nice guy and all that but deep down he is not true to himself and is fake as fuck. He was just on Joe Rogan podcast and exposed himself by backtracking something he said accidently. He has no real opinion, only what his higher ups want to hear. He is the perfect media/corporate man.

AITA for punishing my 16-year-old step-daughter after we found out she was bullying a kid for being poor

Hi reddit, about 2 months ago my wife (f38) and I (m41) learned my step-daughter(f16) was bullying a girl in school over being poor, getting free lunch at school and not being able to afford neccessties such as her own nice car and stuff.

Our daughter was kinda spoiled, we provided her with everything she needed along with an allowance and a part time job at my company (small family service business). We've been considered middle-class, doing things others werent as privileged to do such as buying our daughter a car on her 16th birthday.

I come from a family of immigrants and was considered in poverty growing up, after learning about the bullying i was furious as we thought we didnt raise her to behave that way. She was in honors and top ranking of her class.

I tried to talk to our daughter over why she would do that and i was disturbed to learn it was because she viewed that girl as "trailer trash" which irrated me. The girl from what i learned is very smart and works hard, she bought her own beater car buy herself and works 2 jobs. She considered the money our family had as our families money, so i put her in her place and told her that it was not her money but her mom and I's money.

I decided from that point i was spoiling my daughter too much, we ended up taking away her latest iphone and replacing it with my old iphone 8 (by switching phones with me) with a talk and text plan . We took away her family credit car,sold her car, along with her macbook and other luxuries.

I also told her should would have to find a job without neopotism and work a minimum wage job like everyone else her age, because i'm done giving her handouts if shes gonna act entitled.

Fast forward 2 months later, she is working at a fast food resturant with us driving her around. She doesnt talk to me unless she needs something like a ride but is very upset with me.

My wife feels like i am taking this too far because its affecting her social status and grades and school I however feel like she needs to be humbled because i cant have a daughter who will disrespect people just because the amount of money they have. I also feel that her behaving this way will affect her younger sister (f12) and how she precieves the world.

AITA for punishing my 16-year-old step-daughter after we found out she was bullying a kid for being poor?

Edit:

I also like to add, we took away her MacBook but she still has access to the family computer in the house. Windows computer for school that is powerful (i7 and great gpu) and recently new

She still has wifi access at the house however we did throttle her speed because high speed internet is a privilege, she has fast enough internet to do homework and watch videos that aren’t in HD like Netflix and stuff.

She also isn’t failing, she went from a straight A student to mostly B’s and 2 A’s which I still find great.

Edit #2:

This blew up, I would like to clarify some things, yes we are upper-middle class, not multi-millionaires or anything like that but enough to live comfortably

She is practically my daughter as I’ve raised her since she was practically 4 and her real father walked out on the family when she was 2, my wife helps runs the business and we both agree on punishments. We came to an agreement that I would make decisions with her on things.

We did talk with the family and had her apologize to the girl at school, she was required to do 5 hours of community service at the school (volunteering for food drives and after school activities) due to the schools no bully policy.

We also didn’t force her to get a job, she wanted the job to get money so she could hang out with her friends, and buy things she wanted. We just cut her off from her $15/hr receptionist job for a non-nepotism job. We also warned her that if her grades become too unsustainable she would be forced to quit her job and focus on school because she doesn’t need extracurricular activities outside of school she needs to focus on her education.

You're given a button that can delete any game franchise. Which is it?

It can be because you simply don't like it, or you think the sequels just get worse and worse and it needs to just be put to rest.

I'll start. Call of Duty. Activision milked it for all that it's worth, among other franchises, and I think the only reason people still play it is because that's been their go-to game for so long and they haven't really looked for anything else to play.
