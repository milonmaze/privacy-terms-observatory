Isit weird I live with my parents at 26?

I’m 26 years old living in south west And still living with my parents and I earn 53k but i don’t see the point in moving out my parents house. My mum makes me good food, I don’t have to pay rent, my parents are pretty chill and I can work from home

I only think it’s weird because all my friends have moved out to their own apartmen/flat with their girl/boyfriend or own their own. Idk maybe I’m overthinking shit

Edit: Jheeeze this blew up wtf… luckily my parent have paid of their mortgage otherwise I would def be helping and my mum is kind of overly caring so would want to make food, even when I’m not hungry 🤦🏽‍♂️ I was also living in anothe city for 2 years before lockdown but I’ve been WFH since lockdown so decided to back with my parents as I wouldn’t have to pay rent plus the room I was renting at the time was so small it was claustrophobic

Sounds like a majority of people don’t see a problem in living with parents at this age and that if one is giving the chance to then take the opportunity to save for a mortgage later in life which is def needed!
