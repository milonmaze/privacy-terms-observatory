Kinda feel violated by my GF

I'm 37(m) and I kinda feel like my gf violates me sexually. When we get in arguments her way of getting out of it is to initiating sexual activities. It has been getting worse and worse lately. We have been saving for a house for the last 6 months because I'm over this renting business. This morning I noticed a charge from Gucci on our joint credit card for $863 bucks. Apparently, a clutch was more important than our future family home. When I confronted her she began to grope me in an attempt to change the conversation. I informed her that I am withdrawing consent at the moment because I really wanted to talk. She continued to push forward with unwelcomed sexual touches. I know this sounds crazy coming from a man but it makes me feel cheap and violated.
