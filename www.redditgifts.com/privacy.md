NFL Week 4

[Schefter] NFL and NFLPA are modifying its gambling policies. There now will be increased discipline for gambling on NFL games. Now a violation is one year, and two if a player bets on his own team. Any game fixing will result in banishment. Message from NFL-NFLPA: don’t bet on the NFL.
