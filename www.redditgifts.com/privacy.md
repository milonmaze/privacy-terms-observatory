Well - it's over. I have to admit I was getting cautiously optimistic - but the SCOTUS has killed the Biden/Harris debt relief. Here's some practical FAQ's about the debt relief eligibility and implementation

AITA for refusing to take my kids' calls after finding out my wife committed paternity fraud?

My wife (50F) and I (52M) have not been getting along for the past 5 years. In fact, of our 15 year marriage, around 8 of them were spent sexless. Around 5 years ago, I tried to broach the idea of an amicable divorce but my wife would not have it. She cried, refused to do housework or even acknowledge the kids. She is a SAHM and I work 55+ hours a week as a concierge supervisor at a hotel. I nearly lost my job from the stress of that period.

She finally said that she would divorce after all the kids (14F, 13F, 10M) left the house, and I just gave up and hoped things would pick up. So we settle back to me dealing with demanding guests during the day hoping my $60k a year can turn into $65k one day, and then coming home to a cold, sarcastic wife.

There were times when I found somebody else attractive, but I never acted on those feelings. I just thought about my kids and how I needed to continue to love my wife because she was their mom. And how I could sleep at night knowing I was keeping their parents under one roof.

Then one day I come home to my wife crying. She tells me that she has been unfaithful. And that from age 24 to age 33, she was dating a married man 30 years older than her, but they rekindled their affair a few months after we married.

She told me that we were very poor at the time and that he got her a job at a company and helped supplement her salary with cash gifts, and I never knew about it. All this time I thought it was leasing commissions.

And she tells me that he just died and in the state of Louisiana all biological kids under 24 have a claim to his estate. He stayed with his long suffering wife and refused to acknowledge the girls but my wife said she took my DNA without me knowing a long time ago and that they are not mine, but my son is.

To say I was furious was an understatement. I know part of the reasons she stayed with me is because I had hopes of starting a business but life got in the way. But now that she can sue a rich man's estate she tells me and doesn't seem to care that I filed for divorce the next day.

I left the house within the hour and am now renting a place. Just going to work and circling the drain of depression. It's been a few weeks and my lawyer keeps telling me to make contact with my kids and work out a custody arrangement.

I actually did take a few things that could be used for a DNA test- paid for it to be run only to confirm that only my son is mine. My wife didn't care that I did so.

After it all went down, I started getting calls, starting once a day but now several times a day ( actually 8 calls this morning) from my two oldest "kids." Them leaving me messages crying saying they wanted to talk.

But they aren't actually my kids- everything is a lie and I blow up at anybody who tries to convince me otherwise. My son is too young to call, but he was in one of the messages too. I want to pick up the phone and tell them to leave me alone. They do not feel like family to me right now.

AITA?

Today is Apollo for Reddit's last day, and I just released its last update. ü•π I just wanted to say a big thank you to the folks who have used and supported Apollo over the years, it's been the dream of a lifetime to build this app over the last 9 years. ‚ù§Ô∏è Read the eulogy inside! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Announcement üì£

Hey all,

With that, Apollo's last update has landed! It includes:

Some fun easter eggs!

Tidies some things up for the closure later today

Adds more wallpapers to the ‚ÄúGoodbye Apollo‚Äù wallpaper set

Adds the option to export your Pixel Pals to the separate Pixel Pals app, and gives you a fun easter egg for doing so (or if you download the app while having Apollo installed)

Eulogy

I‚Äôve stared at this empty text editor for like an hour now, and I really don‚Äôt know how to even start this post. It feels like summer camp as a kid when it‚Äôs the last day and everyone is remembering how much fun we had together, while also trying to fight back the emotion of things coming to a close.

So I just really want to say thanks. I set out to build Apollo right out of university and an Apple internship, and wanted to create a Reddit app so good it felt like Apple themselves built it. The initial version was a little rough, but the community grew and grew, and people kept providing such phenomenal feedback that shaped the app into something absolutely unique that was enjoyed by so many people over the years.

It feels disingenuous on the surface to say ‚ÄúI want to thank all of you‚Äù, but in this case it‚Äôs demonstrably true. I‚Äôve worked on this app for over 9 years, and I‚Äôve never felt burned out, I get such a crazy amount of energy and enjoyment out of building something so publicly alongside such an awesome community, and you seriously have no idea how easy product development is when your north star is just ‚Äúlisten to what people are saying‚Äù. So much less guesswork, A/B tests, focus groups, stress, when instead you just talk to people every day and listen. It‚Äôs hard to believe I‚Äôve made almost 20,000 comments in this subreddit!

I‚Äôm really heartbroken with how this whole process unfolded, I truly drank the Kool Aid talking to Reddit at the beginning that this was something they were going into in good faith with the interest of developers, moderators, and the community as a whole, but as many people pointed out to me, it‚Äôs clear now that ultimately wasn‚Äôt their intent. If they wanted something that could work for everyone, they would have simply made an effort to listen, instead of being dishonest, callous, and punitive in pricing. I‚Äôm sorry to all the folks who, like me, lost Apollo abruptly as a result of this. I had so much more I wanted to do with this app!

But, legitimately, I really feel a sense of that ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry because it‚Äôs over, smile because it happened‚Äù right now. I grew up so much developing Apollo, I met and learned from so many incredible people, made lifelong friends, got to go to multiple WWDCs and was even featured in a few, and I got to work on a product and platform I absolutely loved for 9 years. That‚Äôs an incredible run, and it‚Äôs hard to feel anything but thankful for that.

Other Things

Here are some other random things I wanted to take a chance to mention! And hopefully none of it sounds too shill-y, I tried to get a Raids Shadow Legends or Squarespace sponsorship now that my main app is gone, but in the absence of that, I wanted to point out some of the other things I‚Äôm working on that you can support me in if you like what I‚Äôve built and are able to, it would really mean a lot to me! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Update Apollo! This last update includes some fun stuff, easter eggs, migration tools, and a fun mode for the app that automatically enables when I delete my API token later tonight

Check out the ‚ÄúGoodbye Apollo‚Äù Wallpaper set! It‚Äôs 20+ incredible wallpapers by Apollo icon designers, so you‚Äôll be able to remember Apollo for years to come. I‚Äôm so proud of how it came out. It‚Äôs available in the app, but you can also just buy it online too if you want!

Download my Pixel Pals app! It takes the really fun pixel pals functionality in Apollo and makes it into its own separate app with a ton more fun features to customize your iOS device with. It‚Äôs now my only app really, so it would mean a lot to me if you considered supporting it! (There‚Äôs also a secret easter egg for Apollo users!)

If you have time left on a monthly or yearly subscription, please consider declining the automatic refund! These refund costs are paid out-of-pocket by developers and while the small amount left might not matter a lot to you, multiplied across a big user base like Apollo‚Äôs, it gets painfully expensive. Cancelling your subscription or deleting the app is not enough, you have to download Apollo and manually decline the refund, otherwise it‚Äôs automatically given to you. The costs really hit me out of nowhere, a month ago Reddit was still being promising with claims of equitable API pricing, and 4 months before that they said they had no plans to change the API this year.

Beyond that, some people have asked if they can tip jar me directly, and I‚Äôm Canadian so unfortunately no Venmo/Cashapp, but I do have PayPal! I had some questions about crypto too, and I don‚Äôt know that side of things too well, but here‚Äôs a link to my info for that.

Apollo merch is also available! For a short time left, you can use code "RIP" Apollo to get 10% off plus free shipping, they're legitimately very comfortable shirts.

The mythical iPad app is something I was so excited to be able to push out the door, and has been the hardest programming challenge of my career. While it won't get to see the light of day unfortunately, I did want to take the chance to share some details with you about it. I'll upload some screenshots later tonight, but I was really inspired from the outset by Loren Brichter's Twitter for iPad app over a decade ago before I could even code. You have these stacks of content that just effortlessly stack on top of one another so even if you've gone down a deep rabbit hole of content you can easily keep track of things.

Anyway, I just really wanted to write a final post to say a big thanks to the community who used Apollo over the years, it's been the journey and dream of a lifetime working on Apollo, and whatever I do next, be it Pixel Pals, or another thing all together, I'll do my best to make it measure up to Apollo!

I'm not sure if I'll be sticking around on Reddit much beyond this week, but I'm on Twitter and Mastodon if you want to keep in touch wth me!

- Christian

EDIT: Looks like Reddit pulled the plug a little early. Apollo started crashing, but I just manually revoked my token and it looks like it fixes the crashing, but no more Reddit access haha. Those folks are fun to the very end! üòõ In a few hours the app will transition automatically to a fun commemorative mode.
