Reddit Gifts Privacy Notice

Effective October 15, 2020.

We want you to understand how and why Reddit collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use Reddit Gifts. The main Reddit Privacy Policy also applies to your use of Reddit Gifts. This Privacy Notice explains some important additional things you should know about the information we collect, use, and share when you use Reddit Gifts.

Additional Information You Provide to Us
Account Information

If you choose to create a Reddit Gifts account, you must provide some personal information so that we can provide our services to you. We collect the information you provide when you create a Reddit Gifts account, including your email, password, Reddit account username, first and last name, and mailing address. You can choose to provide additional information, including a bio, profile picture, shipping instructions, information about your social media accounts, and a link to a wish list or other website of your choosing. Any information we collect for your use of Reddit Gifts may be associated with the Reddit account being used for Reddit Gifts.

Public Information

Your Reddit Gifts account has a profile page that is public. This page contains your Reddit account username, bio, profile picture, and information about your activities on Reddit Gifts (e.g., Trophies, gifts sent, and gifts received). Your Reddit Gifts public profile also links to your Reddit profile.

Additional Information We Share

We will ask for your consent before sharing your information in a manner other than those that are set out in this Notice or the Privacy Policy.

Gift Exchange Information

When you participate in a gift exchange, we provide your match with the information necessary to complete the exchange, including your first and last name, Reddit account, email address, and address. You may also choose to share additional information, including shipping instructions, information about your social media accounts, a link to a wish list or other website of your choosing, personal interests, answers to exchange-specific questions, and shipping proof. If an exchange fails, we may provide an alternate match (a “rematcher”) with the information necessary to complete the exchange. Following the completion of an exchange, your gift exchange information is no longer viewable on Reddit Gifts by your match.

Controlling Promotional Communications

You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or use of Reddit Gifts.

Deleting Your Account

To delete your Reddit Gifts account, contact support through this form. When you delete your Reddit Gifts account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, photos, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.

If you would like to delete your Reddit account in addition to your Reddit Gifts account, please follow the process outlined in the Privacy Policy.

Children

People under the age of 18 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use Reddit Gifts.

Changes to This Notice

We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time as described in Section 8 of the Reddit Gifts User Agreement. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice and Reddit’s Privacy Policy whenever you access or use Reddit Gifts or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

If you have questions about this Privacy Notice, you can contact us directly as described in the “Contact Us” section of Reddit’s Privacy Policy.
