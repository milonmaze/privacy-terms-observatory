Matt Barnes: "I spoke on Ime Udoka's defense and after finding out the facts I erased what I posted because this situation in Boston is deep, messy and 100 times uglier than any of us thought. Some things happened I can't condone. It's not my place to tell you what happened."

Why, in Canada, were activists fighting for women to wear a hijab, while in Iran - they're fighting for women to not wear the hijab?

I know. Am Stupid. Just can't quite grasp why they fight to wear it in Canada, but protest against it in Iran.
