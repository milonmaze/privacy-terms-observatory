AITA for being honest with my girlfriend when she asked a question about the birthday cake she made me?

I (34M) had a birthday just yesterday, and my girlfriend (36F) offered to bake me a cake. I told her that I would prefer a chocolate cake (devil's food) with chocolate icing and nothing fancy. She is usually a great baker, and I guess she thought that wasn't sophisticated enough or something. She baked me a chocolate cake with vanilla icing between the two layers of cake then surrounding in chocolate frosting.

The cake was fine, but I was disappointed because it was not what I wanted. She must have noticed and asked me if I was disappointed, so I was honest with her. Yes. I was disappointed. It wasn't the cake I asked for. I said, "If I wanted vanilla in a cake, I would have asked for vanilla in the cake."

I didn't make a scene. I didn't pout. I even ate half of a slice--the chocolate part. She got upset with me and said, "But I've made vanilla cake before, and you liked it." I pointed out that I don't mind vanilla icing, but **it's not what I wanted for my birthday**. Her feelings were hurt, and she even pulled a "I'm not going to make you any cake next year," which I replied with, "I will order my own and get my money back if they don't do it like I want it." Apparently that was the last straw. She asked me to leave, later texted me that I embarrassed her in front of her kids, and now she won't reply to my messages.

I think birthdays are important things, and I feel like I was honest with her when she asked me. I didn't want to lie about it. My friend told me I should have been grateful that she made me a cake at all, especially one that I've eaten and liked in the past. Maybe I overreacted a bit, though I don't feel like I did and hope to get a second opinion. AITA here?
