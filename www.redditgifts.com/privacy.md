I accidentally stared at my coworkers cleavage for a second ,she noticed and kept hand on her breast hiding it for atleast 5-10 minutes .

Me a 26M started a new job and I have a huge crush on a coworker, today she was explaining me few company policies and while talking to her i noticed her cleavage unintentionally, I was not even observing her, but my eyes went there for a second ,as soon as I look up she kept her hand on her breast while talking to me for until the discussion was over.

Even after an hour when I talked to her again she kept hand on her breast.

I feel really bad I made her uncomfortable. I am planning to shift my seat away from her from next Monday.

Edit - fuckk i didn't knew this post would blow up, for those people who are blaming me or her, let me share some more details. She is a 24 years old , professional, and she was dressed modestly , but there are always some angles for every dress, and it was that angle today. She was not showing cleavage "Intentionally".

Me, i cannot hold on eye contact with someone for more than a minute, my eyes keeps rotating, and while rotating it went over there, and idk why but they stopped there for a second. Definitely not more than a second.

Update: My fiancé is asking questions about my sex life. I don’t want to lie, but I need to know the best way to answer honestly without hurting him

So I’ll get on with the update but I just want to make a few things clear first.

For the hundreds of incels and incel adjacent men telling me that I’m settling for my fiancé kindly get some help. I am not settling for him. He is not a meal ticket, in fact I outearn him by a decent amount. I’m HIS meal ticket. The presumption that just because I’ve had better sex that I’m settling is so far from correct.

Next, I frequently was asked why this came up. So my fiancé has told me multiple times that I’m his best sexual partner ever. Which may or may not be true. That being said, he’s been with a smaller number of women. I had about a 1 in 4 chance, so it’s nothing to brag about. Because he told me this, he became curious if he was mine.

Lastly I just want to say to all the insecure me who commented and DM’d me in a genuine nice way, I’m sorry you feel that way. But remember she chose you. She chooses you every single day she’s with you. If she didn’t think you were special and amazing and the “best” person available for her you wouldn’t be with her. Most men don’t do the bare minimum, if you are focusing on her pleasure you’re already doing better than 80% of men. Chances are, if you’re not the best, but you have a good sex life, you’re pretty damn close.

If you’re not her Michael Jordan, you’re probably her Larry Bird.

So onto the update.

So yesterday night the question came back up again. I told him I wanted to have an open discussion about the question and I had evaded answering because I genuinely needed time to think about it.

First I told him that, I didn’t want to sleep with any man anymore except him for the rest of my life. I told him that if I couldn’t have sex with him and only him, I wouldn’t ever have sex with anyone again. Which is all true.

Next I told him that I would never choose a relationship based solely on how good the sex was and that being an amazing lover is worthless if I don’t feel emotionally cared for. That being emotionally cared for transforms sex into something completely different and that is what I want above all else in bed. Someone who I feel emotionally cared for me and makes me feel safe, sexy and above all else, loved.

Here’s where I’ll lose people I gave him the honest answer. I told him that I have had experiences that were exceptionally good due to factors outside of skill in bed. However when I look back on those experiences they aren’t something I want anymore. I want him.

I felt like this was a very careful way to give him a genuine answer that still made it clear I put him over all other men without dodging or lying.

The last thing I mentioned was that we have our entire lives together to create new sexual experiences and for us to learn each other’s bodies and make each other feel things that we’ve never felt befor, but the only way to do that is if we don’t focus on what happened in the past and what we can do in the future. I said that I have no doubt that he’ll be the best I’ve ever had if we both put in a little more work into perfecting our sex life and communiting our needs as desires to each other, which is something we don’t do as much as we should. I told him I’m willing to validate him as much as he needs me to to ensure that he doesn’t feel insecurity about this.

He took it very well. He told me he did feel insecure since I’m his best and I’m so much more experienced and was worried if he’s not but what I said made him feel better and he agreed that we should be doing more communication. So our homework is to now look to the future, think about what we can do to take our sex life to the next level without worrying about the past.

We also decided to book a cruise for the holidays. So we could do 3 things we’ve both never done before, go on a cruise, visit another country, fuck the absolute hell out of each other on a cruise. So I’m feeling optimistic.

Thanks for all the suggestions i would’ve royally fucked that up without them.

Edit: l can’t believe I need to say this, but the guy in question is not my best due to his penis size. Drop it, men are needlessly obsessed with the size of other mens dicks. It’s weird.

AITA for wanting a divorce because my wife doesn’t want her son to be legally mine

I’ve been in her sons life for the past 4 years since he was 2 , he already calls me dad all that’s left is to make it legal, but my wife thinks that decision to make it legal should be up to her son but wants to wait till he is old enough to make that decision which I think is completely silly right ? She also doesn’t want anymore kids which I’ve come to terms with. I’m at a loss now I don’t know what to do. I also heard from her friend she doesn’t want to make it legal because if we divorce she doesn’t want to have to fight me for custody. Edit: she changed her mind about wanting more kids because of her career I accepted it and we compromised on letting me adopt him but now she’s stalling .the bio dad has never been in the picture, she doesn’t even know who he is . UPDATE: she has agreed to let me be the legal guardian in case anything happens to her and we will continue to wait till he is old enough to decide if he wants to be adopted. This is not what I want but I’m willing to compromise. Thank you all for your comments.

AITA For telling my wife I hate her new job

My wife (37F) and I (38M) have been married for 12 years and have 3 kids (10, 8, & 6). During the pandemic, my wife's job allowed her to switch to 100% WFH. They never required her to go back to the office because her productivity actually increased so there was no need. It made things easier for us too. I dropped the kids off at school/daycare in the morning and she picked them up in the afternoon. She was able to keep up with a few things around the house during the day, we saved on gas and car maintenance, etc.

A few months ago, she was contacted by a recruiter about a job. It would be a nice step up in her career path as well as a boost in pay. But there were drawbacks. The company had no WFH policy and would require her to work in the office. This was apparently non-negotiable. It would also be a 45-minute commute for her.

We talked it over a lot and I expressed my concerns about how this would impact our daily lives. I told her that I don't necessarily think that the bump in pay is worth the major changes to our daily lives. Not to mention the stress that a long commute can have on people and that could impact their mood and how they interact at home.

She assured me that everything would be fine and that we would adjust as a family and soon the new routine would just become our new normal. I told her that I would never tell her NOT to take the job, but I just don't know if it is worth the changes that it is going to bring. Ultimately, the decision was hers and she accepted the new job. She's been there for about 10 weeks now.

To say it has been an adjustment is an understatement. She wakes up and leaves before the kids even get up. She'll help get a few things ready for them before she goes, but the entire morning kid routine is on me. I also do both drop-off and pick-up for all the kids too. Evenings have been a huge mess because I get home and try to get the kids distracted while I start dinner. When my wife gets home, she is usually stressed from the drive (her commute has turned into over an hour due to construction and traffic) and takes 15 minutes for herself to calm down before eating alone. Then, after dinner she's going to bed earlier because she has to wake up earlier.

I told her that I feel her new job has put an unfair amount of household and childcare duties on me and that she is being far less present in our lives when she's home. She told me that we just need to give it more time to adjust and things will get easier. I told her that 10-weeks is a pretty good adjustment period and I hate it so far. She told me I'm being an unsupportive jerk and I need to give it more time.

EDIT: I don't have the emotional bandwidth right now to deal with the huge amount of sexist BS I'm getting here. Those kind of responses are why men don't open up when they feel EXACTLY like I do right now and just bottle this up. I have to get ready to pick up my kids. They're getting happy meals tonight because f*&^ it.

People who support Communism on Reddit have never lived in a communist country

Otherwise they wouldn’t support Communism or claim “the right communism hasn’t been tried yet” they would understand that all forms of communism breed authoritarian dictators and usually cause suffering/starvation on a genocidal scale. It’s clear anyone who supports communism on this site lives in a western country and have never seen what Communism does to a country.

Edit: The whataboutism is strong in this thread. I never claimed Capitalism was perfect or even good. I just know I would rather live in any Western, capitalist country any day of the week before I would choose to live in Communism.
