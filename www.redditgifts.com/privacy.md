Straight men of reddit why do you like thick thighs soo much?

I keep seeing these reels where the guy wants to get suffocated by the girls thighs and the comment section is filled with other guys commenting how he has achieved life's purpose. I don't get if this is a joke or you guys actually want it

By thick I mean bigger thighs with a regular body. Not fat you guys are misinterpreting it.
