What if your girlfriend decided to stop shaving everything.

My girlfriend of 5 years and I were having a discussion on what I would do if she had just stopped shaving everything. Legs, armpits, all of it. We are both young and I understand at some point she wonâ€™t be able to but weâ€™re talking about right now.

Iâ€™m curious what other peopleâ€™s response would be.

AITAH for breaking up with my pregnant girlfriend because I donâ€™t want to be a father?

AITA for breaking up with my pregnant girlfriend because I donâ€™t want to be a father.

I (25M) had been with my now ex (23F) for a little over 3 months. I always made sure we used lots of precaution when having sex. She was on birth control and I always used condoms. I wanted to avoid a child. I have known for a long time that I do not want children. I find them annoying and they would severely limit my ability to do the things I enjoy (traveling, outdoors stuff, etc.). Unfortunately for me, my ex didnâ€™t have her period when she was supposed to and it turns out sheâ€™s now pregnant. She came to me and told me she was pregnant.

The first thing I did was suggest an abortion. We donâ€™t live in a state where itâ€™s legal so I offered to pay for her flight and hotel and told her Iâ€™d be happy to come with her to get it done. I have a stable job and make good money so it isnâ€™t wouldnâ€™t be too much of a hit for me. She works as a receptionist and doesnâ€™t make a lot so I figured it would be better for me to pay. Thatâ€™s when she told me she was hoping to keep it and that she wanted me to help her raise the kid as itâ€™s father.

I have no intention of being a father. Beyond just my dislike of children, Iâ€™m not ready for that. I made it very clear that I didnâ€™t want the baby, but she kept insisting that Iâ€™d have a change of heart once itâ€™s born and to just try it out. After a long exchange I told her that if she intended to keep the baby I would not act as a father. I broke up with her and told her that I would pay child support once itâ€™s born, but that I expect her to respect my wishes and keep the child away from me. Since then sheâ€™s been frantically texting me, begging me to come back and telling me sheâ€™d forgive me. Sheâ€™s sent me voicemails crying, it does hurt to see, but I havenâ€™t responded.

The other day she texted me saying how she canâ€™t raise the kid alone and how Iâ€™m basically forcing her to get the abortion just by leaving. She called me an asshole, an abuser, and a sexist. She ended the text begging me to talk again. I certainly feel shitty, I really liked her and we had a good relationship before this, but I just donâ€™t want to be a father. Iâ€™m already bitter about the fact that Iâ€™ll have to pay child support for 18 years, which will somewhat limit me financially. I also feel it isnâ€™t right for a parent who doesnâ€™t want their child to be involved. Iâ€™d just end up taking that pent up anger and bitterness out on the child who is ultimately innocent, which I feel isnâ€™t right.

With all this said I come here to ask, AITA? I certainly feel like one, but I also stand by what I did.

Clarifying edits: On the topic of a vasectomy, I tried. I met with a doctor last year and asked about getting one, but he refused and said every doctor he knows wonâ€™t do it until youâ€™re at least 30. Itâ€™s a conservative state and while I dislike the politics, I was born and raised here so Iâ€™m still attached to the state and have never felt the urge to leave. Someone said I should have flown elsewhere to get one, and I guess theyâ€™re right but I just didnâ€™t think about that.

On the topic of birth control, I bought the condoms myself so they were fine. Whenever we were done Iâ€™d throw used condoms Iâ€™m the dumpster so I donâ€™t think she went dumpster diving. I asked her on our first date if she was taking birth control and she said yes, I took her for her word. Maybe foolish to just believe her, but if she was lying sheâ€™d be the first Iâ€™ve met to lie about that. Most girls Iâ€™ve met are honest about it. I assumed she was on the pill since thatâ€™s the main birth control I know, but maybe she was on something else that Iâ€™m not educated enough on. That being said, Iâ€™ll follow your advice and lawyer up + get a paternity test. IDK how long that will take, but whenever I get it done Iâ€™ll update here with results. Thank you for your judgements, Iâ€™ve been away for a bit but Iâ€™m catching up and trying to read what I can. Iâ€™ll be checking back periodically and replying to some people, all further feedback is appreciated.
