I signed this measure with a deep sense of pride that the United States is an open society in which the people's right to know is cherished and guarded.

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law that provides the public with a right to access government records. The purpose of the law is to ensure an informed citizenry by providing the public with access to information that sheds light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties. The FOIA provides that any person may ask any federal agency for records and that the agency must provide those records, unless an exemption applies or the records fall outside the coverage of the FOIA.
