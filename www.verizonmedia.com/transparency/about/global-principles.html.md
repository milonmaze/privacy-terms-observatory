Global principles for responding to government requests

We've built our brands and earned the trust of our users over more than two decades. We're committed to preserving and protecting that trust. This is why we pay careful attention to government requests for user data and content removal and respond to these requests in accordance with the following three principles:

Minimize disclosure of user data and restrictions to freedom of expression online. We minimize the disclosure of user data and the restriction of user content by narrowly interpreting government requests in these areas.

Protect human rights, including the rights to privacy and freedom of expression. We examine all appropriate options when faced with a government request that raises human rights concerns, including seeking clarification or modification or contesting the request.

Be accountable and transparent with our users. We share information with our users about how we handle government requests and about our disclosure of user data and removal of content.
