Verizon Media may set or read cookies and device identifiers when you use our brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (“Services”) or visit a website, app, or service that utilizes our Services. A cookie is a small piece of information that is stored on a computer or device and may contain a device identifier for the purpose of recognizing your browser as you interact with websites. Device identifiers may be randomly generated or assembled from available system elements such as IP address, browser version, OS type and version, device type and settings, mobile device and advertising identifiers (such as Apple’s ID for Advertising, Apple's ID for Vendors, Google’s Android ID, or Google's Play Store Ad ID), wireless mobile subscriber ISDN numbers, Verizon Wireless UIDH, public switched telephone network information, mobile network information or software data.

Verizon Media's Practices Regarding Cookies and Similar Technologies

Verizon Media may use cookies and similar technologies in combination with other information we maintain for a number of purposes, including to:

Access your information when you "sign in" so we can provide you with customized content and experiences, or remember the last page you visited in an Verizon Media Service.
Information that Verizon Media collects related to your activities and interests is maintained by Verizon Media and is associated with Verizon Media cookies and similar technologies. You can learn more about Verizon Media’s data retention and storage practices here.
Maintain your settings and authenticate your identity while you are logged in using Verizon Media Services.
When you log in to your account for Verizon Media products or Services (“Verizon Media Account”), a cookie and/or device identifier that links to information about your interests is placed or read on the computer or device you are using. This allows Verizon Media to associate your interests, activities, preferences, and prior Verizon Media use if you log in to your Verizon Media Account on or otherwise use multiple devices. This means that your browsing habits or other activity on your work computer, library computer, or other device, can inform your experience on Verizon Media when using your home computer or other devices.
Deliver advertisements and content relevant to your interests.
Verizon Media collects and maintains information about your interests based on your use of the Verizon Media Services, others’ sites, apps, and services within the Verizon Media Network, as well as other non-Verizon Media sites, apps, and services that we partner with. Verizon Media may combine this information with other information that we collect or receive about you.
Provide analytics and reporting.
Verizon Media Analytics, Advertising Insights, and Flurry are systems used by Verizon Media to collect information about visitors to Verizon Media's and our customers' sites, apps, products, brands and services to understand how people use those services and respond to the ads we serve.
Maintain information in both identifiable and de-identified forms.
Verizon Media associates your observed interests and activities with your Verizon Media Account, and may combine this information with other information we have collected about you.
Conduct research and measure effectiveness to improve Verizon Media's Services (including by determining which Verizon Media emails you open and act upon).
To support security measures, such as requiring re-logging into an Verizon Media product or service after a certain amount of time has elapsed.
To assist in identifying possible fraudulent or abusive activities.
​Other Companies' Cookies on Verizon Media
In addition to Verizon Media using cookies and similar technologies on our Services, we allow certain Third Parties to set or access their cookies and similar technologies on your device. These companies’ use of cookies and similar technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Verizon Media Privacy Policy.
