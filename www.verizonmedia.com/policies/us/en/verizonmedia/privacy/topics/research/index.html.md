Research

From time to time, Yahoo may invite users to participate in usability studies, surveys, and other types of qualitative and quantitative research to help us better design our site, plan new features to add to our products and services, and help us understand our users' wants and needs. Yahoo also conducts research using data from our internal records.

Research Panels
Yahoo recruits research subjects through a variety of means, including advertisements, email messages, and through market research firms.
Participants in research are often required to sign separate privacy or confidentiality agreements and may be compensated for their time.
Internal Information
Information about audiences and traffic from Yahoo's own log files and user databases may also be used for research purposes in an ongoing effort to improve our products and services.
Information Sharing and Disclosure Practices
Statistics from research may be shared with our partners, prospective partners, or advertisers when these data are aggregated, de-identified, or averaged across many users.
