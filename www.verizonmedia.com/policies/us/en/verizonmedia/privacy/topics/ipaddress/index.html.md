IP Address

When your device makes requests from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This is called your device's "IP address." (IP stands for "Internet Protocol.")

Information Collection and Use Practices

Verizon Media generally receives IP addresses from all users of all brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (“Services”)
Your IP address may be stored in our user registration databases when you register with Verizon Media.
IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to:
Diagnose service or technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.
Send the most appropriate advertising to you based on geographic area or information derived from your IP address.
Associate users, devices, and accounts with each other or with those in a similar location, such as in a household.
Report aggregate or other information derived from IP addresses to advertisers. We do not share information that on its own can be used to reasonably identify or contact you (such as your name or email address).
Estimate the total number of users visiting Verizon Media Services from specific countries or regions of the world.
Assist merchants in our stores and shopping Services to track visits to and business at their stores.
Help determine which users have access privileges to certain content that we host.
Fraud & abuse detection and prevention.
Detecting and investigating potential criminal activity.

Other

When an Verizon Media Service is requested, that request is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the device making the request.
Verizon Media Mail Services include IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers, as specified by standard Internet protocol.
Yahoo Messenger sometimes uses a peer-to-peer connection during its operation, including times when you may be using it for instant messaging (text conversations), file sharing and webcam streaming. Peer-to-peer means that your device connects directly to the other user's device in the conversation without needing to go through Verizon Media servers. As such, your IP address is available to users you share a peer-to-peer connection with.
