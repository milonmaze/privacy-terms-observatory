Third Parties

The following third party companies may use a variety of tools, including IP Addresses, applications (or "widgets"), web beacons, SDKs, cookies, and similar technologies when people use our brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (“Services”) or see the ads provided by our advertising Services. These companies may collect information about other apps on your various devices, the websites you visit, location information, and other information. In addition, Verizon Media may share information that cannot be used to identify you personally, including pseudonymous demographic information, about you with partners for Service improvements, research and analysis, to provide personalized advertising, to help them provide you more innovative experiences and content and to help Verizon Media communicate with you about offers from Verizon Media and our marketing partners.

Verizon Media aims to deliver the most engaging user experience to meet the needs of our users. Please check back regularly for any updates to third party policies.

Analytics partners

Verizon Media works with companies that provide services to us to determine whether users who saw or clicked on an ad or content later bought the item displayed in the ad (or took some other action the advertiser wanted them to take). To do this, these companies may collect information about the content or ads users view, how long they spend on different pages, how they arrived on a particular page (e.g., through a search query, link from another page, or a bookmark), and how they respond to the ads we show them. Verizon Media also may share portions of our log file data, including IP address, with these partners for analytics purposes. In the event your IP address is shared, this information may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited an Verizon Media Service in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit Verizon Media Services. These partners provide information about our advertising and what you see using Verizon Media Services to provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.

The analytics providers with whom we work include, but are not limited to, the companies listed below. Some of these companies provide users choices about how they collect and use information. For more information, please review their privacy policies.

Social Buttons, Applications, and Widgets

Verizon Media may implement an application or “widget” from a third party on some of our sites and apps that allows interaction or content sharing by Verizon Media users. These widgets are visible to you on the page you visit. The network providing the widget may offer controls for you to manage the widget’s appearance and functionality. Your interaction with a widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you, including IP address, page header information, and browser information. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its widgets even when you do not interact with the widget but visit a web page or use an app with the widget. Verizon Media allows social buttons, applications, and widgets from the following partners:

Advertising technologies

Most advertisements you see on Verizon Media Services are served by Verizon Media. However, we also allow certain companies to serve advertisements and collect information within our Services. These companies include third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content, research firms, and other companies that help us provide more effective advertising.

These companies do things like help us deliver ads to people who are most likely to be interested in seeing them, keep track of the number of users who saw a particular ad or visited a particular page of one of our websites, analyze the effectiveness of our ads, and provide auditing, research and reporting for advertisers. Because your browser, app, or device communicates with the third party’s servers, these companies can collect information, including your IP address, page header information, browser or device information, just as if you had requested their webpage or used their apps directly. These companies may collect information to deliver you customized ads on both Verizon Media and non-Verizon Media websites, applications, and services. In some situations, Verizon Media may interact with these companies outside of your browser or device, directly between our web servers.

The following third parties offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites. Please visit each company’s privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you.

Biometric Technology Providers

The biometric technology providers with whom we work are listed below. These companies may provide users choices about how they collect and use information. For more information, please review their privacy policies.

Apple
Integration of Apple’s TrueDepth API into Verizon Media applications may allow you to use the Verizon Media application, in combination with your device’s camera, to virtually apply face paint filters or face accessories to your facial image (this TrueDepth API functionality is collectively referred to below as “face filters”).

The Verizon Media application will require access to your device's camera in order for you to use the face filter functionality. This access may be toggled on or off at any time in your device's settings. 

The camera images and any resulting data from your use of face filters are only used for the current session and to provide the face filter functionality. The live video feed that you see while using the face filters is only used for the purpose of providing the feature, and this data is not stored locally or remotely. Further any data related to your use of face filters is stored only on the device, and only for the duration of your current face filter session. Each time the home screen is presented or the application is closed, the data is deleted. Verizon Media does not store or share with third parties data related to your use of the face filters functionality. 
Voice and Digital Assistant Providers

The voice and digital assistant providers with whom we work are listed below. These companies may provide users choices about how they collect and use information. For more information, please review their privacy policies.

Amazon
Apple
Verizon Media applications may allow you to interact with them using Apple’s Siri functionality (iOS 12 or above). Use of Apple's Siri with Verizon Media applications requires your recorded audio data be sent to Apple for speech recognition, processing and/or transcription purposes.  Such audio data may be used by Apple to improve and provide Apple products and services. 
Google
Other partnerships

Verizon Media partners with companies who may offer products or services to you based on the current page content or other criteria. These partners may be in the form of the "Get the Look" bar on celebrity pictures or a sidebar with topical products. Because your browser, app, or device must request the content from the partner's servers, these providers can collect your information, including your IP address, page header information, and browser information:
