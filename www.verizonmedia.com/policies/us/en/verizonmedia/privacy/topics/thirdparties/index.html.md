Third Parties

Third party companies may use a variety of tools, technologies, or information, including IP Addresses, applications, web beacons, SDKs, and cookies when people use our brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (“Services”) or see the ads provided by our advertising Services. These companies may collect information about other apps on your various devices, the websites you visit, location information, and other information. In addition, Yahoo may share non-personally identifiable information, including pseudonymous demographic information, about you and your use of Yahoo services with partners for Service improvements, research and analysis, to provide personalized advertising, to help them provide you more innovative experiences and content and to help Yahoo communicate with you about offers from Yahoo and our marketing partners. Yahoo contractually prohibits partners from re-identifying your pseudonymous data, unless they first obtain your consent.

Details about some of the types of partners we work with are provided below. This list isn’t complete and Yahoo continuously works with new partners, and types of partners, on our Services as new technologies and features become available.

Analytics partners

Yahoo works with companies that provide services to us and our advertising partners to determine whether users who saw or clicked on an ad or content later bought the item displayed in the ad (or took some other action the advertiser wanted them to take). To do this, these companies may collect information about the content or ads users view, how long they spend on different pages, how they arrived on a particular page (e.g., through a search query, link from another page, or a bookmark), and how they respond to the ads we show them. Yahoo also may share portions of our log file data, including IP address, with these partners for analytics purposes. In the event your IP address is shared, this information may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited a Yahoo Service in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit ourServices. These partners provide information about our advertising and what you see using our Services to provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.

Social Buttons, applications, and widgets

Yahoo may implement a social button, application, or other “widget” from a third party on some of our sites and apps that allows interaction or content sharing by Yahoo users. These social buttons, applications, or widgets are visible to you on the page you visit. The network providing the social button, application, or widget may offer controls for you to manage the social button’s, application’s, or widget’s appearance and functionality. Your interaction with a social button, application, or widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you, including IP address, page header information, and browser information. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its social button, application, or widget even when you do not interact with it but visit a web page or use an app with the social button, application, or widget.

Advertising technologies

Advertisements you see on our Services are served by Yahoo, and our partners, like Google and Taboola. We also allow certain companies to serve advertisements and collect information within our Services, and in some instances Yahoo discloses pseudonymous information to these companies as described in our Privacy Policy. These companies include third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content, research firms, and other companies that help us provide more effective advertising.

These companies do things like help us deliver ads to people who are most likely to be interested in seeing them, keep track of the number of users who saw a particular ad or visited a particular page of one of our websites, analyze the effectiveness of our ads, and provide auditing, research and reporting for advertisers. Because your browser, app, or device communicates with the third party’s servers, these companies can collect information, including your IP address, page header information, browser or device information, just as if you had requested their webpage or used their apps directly. As discussed at the top of this page, these companies may collect information from you and use the pseudonymous information that we may provide to them to deliver you customized ads on both Yahoo and non-Yahoo websites, applications, and services. In some situations, Yahoo may interact with these companies outside of your browser or device, directly between our web servers. Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive interest-based ads. To learn more, please visit the websites of the regional self-regulatory bodies listed in Ad Serving, where third parties may be listed.

Content providers

Yahoo partners with various content providers who provide content to you on our Services. These content providers may provide services such as providing you maps from one partner and news from a different partner or allowing you to view social media posts. Because your browser, app, or device must request the content from the content provider's servers, these providers can collect your information, including your IP address, page header information, browser information, and other information just as if you had visited their website or used their app directly.

Video content providers

Yahoo strives to deliver engaging video content that is developed or hosted by Yahoo, however, we also partner with some video content providers to deliver engaging video content. These providers can collect your information, such as your IP address, page header information, browser information, flash player version, internet speed, and the portion of the video watched.

Games developers

Yahoo and AOL Games host games from sponsors and developers that are hopefully interesting and fun to you. Some of these games may have additional terms and conditions and privacy policies associated with them.

Because your browser or device must request the content from the content provider's servers, these providers can collect your information, including your IP address, browser information, and flash player version. In addition, games developers may record game scores, your entered game name, your user settings, or other game play actions which may be governed by the additional terms of service for the game.

Search partners

Third parties may provide search and search advertising results for Yahoo. Search advertising includes paid search and/or contextual search results. More than one search partner may be used at the same time and may change based on factors such as type of online experience, type of device used, and the country the search is performed from. Search partners may also provide search widgets and other features to make your search experience better, such as easy access to information about concert tickets or nearby airline flights.

Biometric technology providers

The biometric technology providers with whom we work are listed below. These companies may provide users choices about how they collect and use information. For more information, please review their privacy policies.

Apple
Integration of Apple’s TrueDepth API into Yahoo applications may allow you to use the Yahoo application, in combination with your device’s camera, to virtually apply face paint filters or face accessories to your facial image (this TrueDepth API functionality is collectively referred to below as “face filters”).

The Yahoo application will require access to your device's camera in order for you to use the face filter functionality. This access may be toggled on or off at any time in your device's settings.

The camera images and any resulting data from your use of face filters are only used for the current session and to provide the face filter functionality. The live video feed that you see while using the face filters is only used for the purpose of providing the feature, and this data is not stored locally or remotely. Further any data related to your use of face filters is stored only on the device, and only for the duration of your current face filter session. Each time the home screen is presented or the application is closed, the data is deleted. Yahoo does not store or share with third parties data related to your use of the face filters functionality.

Voice and digital assistant providers

The voice and digital assistant providers with whom we work are listed below. These companies may provide users choices about how they collect and use information. For more information, please review their privacy policies.

Amazon
Apple
Yahoo applications may allow you to interact with them using Apple’s Siri functionality (iOS 12 or above). Use of Apple's Siri with Yahoo applications requires your recorded audio data be sent to Apple for speech recognition, processing and/or transcription purposes. Such audio data may be used by Apple to improve and provide Apple products and services.
