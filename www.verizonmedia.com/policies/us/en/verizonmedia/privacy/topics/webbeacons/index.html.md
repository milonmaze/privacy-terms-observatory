Beacons & SDKs

Sites, apps, videos, emails, and other services may contain a small snippet of code called a beacon or in mobile apps contain an SDK or Software Development Kit. In their simplest form, beacons and SDKs allow a service to transfer or collect information through a server request. Verizon Media brands, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (“Services”) may use beacons and SDKs for many purposes, including counting the number of users who visit a webpage, download an app, or read an email; site usage analytics; advertising auditing and reporting; and content and advertising personalization.

We may use the information we collect through beacons and SDKs:

Other Companies’ Beacons & SDKs on Verizon Media
In addition to Verizon Media using beacons & SDKs on our network of sites and apps, we allow certain Third Parties to include their own beacons & SDKs within our sites and apps. These companies use of beacons & SDKs is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Verizon Media Privacy Policy.
Some Third Parties may have technology enabling them to act as "containers" for additional beacons, typically these are called piggyback beacons. Verizon Media may not always be aware of these piggyback beacons, however, you can check what beacons exist on a webpage using privacy tools.
