Search and Chat Services

This page describes our current privacy practices for Yahoo Search and Yahoo Chat. Everything you share with Yahoo, or save in your Yahoo Account, is kept safe and handled according to our Privacy Policy. As we update our services, adding new features or changing how we do things, our privacy practices might change too. Remember, some features are just for those who've signed up. If you have any questions about our search services, feel free to check out our Help page.

Yahoo Search
Information Collection & Use Practices
Search: When you conduct a search on a product or service that uses our search technology, we collect information from your experience, such as your search queries.
Search Assist: This feature helps you find what you are looking for by automatically suggesting popular search terms and new topics based on aggregated searches and your individual search history.
Search History: The Yahoo Search and Chat History tool allows you to see your past Search activities. Learn how to manage your Yahoo Search and Chat history.
Private Results: When signed in, you may see relevant, private results from other sources, such as your Yahoo Mail. Only you can see these results. Learn how to manage, including turning off, Private Results.
Customized Advertising: Some advertising you receive on Yahoo may be customized based on your searches, or related terms at Yahoo. Please visit your Dashboard & Controls to manage and learn more about the information used to personalize your Yahoo experience.
Image Recognition: Yahoo Search uses image recognition algorithms to identify public figures, scenes, actions, or objects to make it easier to search images.

Search Partners

Third-Party Involvement: Various third parties help provide search, and search advertising results for Yahoo. More than one search or search partner may be used simultaneously and may change based on factors such as type of online experience, type of device used, and the country the search is performed from. Search advertising includes paid search and contextual search results.
Search Widgets: Search partners may also provide search widgets and features to make your search experience better, such as easy access to information about concert tickets or nearby airline flights.
Information Sharing: We may share your search query, IP address, and other pseudonymous information from your web browser or app, such as a unique identifier for your web browser, with these search partners. They may use this information, as well as your search results clicks, to provide more relevant advertising and search results, for search product improvement, research and analysis, and to help detect and defend against fraudulent activity on sponsored or contextual search results.
Reformatted Results: We may reformat results provided by these search partners for an enhanced search experience.

Sponsored Search Results

Paid Placement: Search results may include sites that have paid for placement. Learn more.
Tracking URLs: Search results may contain tracking URLs provided by Yahoo Search Marketing and/or our search partners to identify clicks from the search results page.

European Residents

URL Blocking: European residents can request that certain URLs be blocked from search results in certain circumstances.
Yahoo Chat

Yahoo Chat provides an AI-powered chat service offering more conversational and detailed responses to general queries than traditional search services. Due to the nature of AI technology, unforeseen responses or errors may occur.

Information Collection & Use Practices
Device and Experience Information: When you use Yahoo Chat, we collect information from your device and experience, including your queries and the responses provided.
Response Links: Responses may include links to information sources and suggested follow-up queries. Clicking these links may redirect you away from Yahoo sites and apps.
Service Analysis and Improvement: Yahoo uses your Chat information to analyze engagement, improve our services and features, secure our products and services, and optimize performance.
Chat History: The Yahoo Chat History control available within Chat shows your recent queries. If you delete queries using the in-product control, they are removed from display and will no longer be used for product features. However, depending on your privacy settings, Yahoo may continue to use those Chat queries to personalize your ads or content.
Customized Advertising: Some advertising you receive on Yahoo may be customized based on your queries in Chat. Please visit your Dashboard & Controls to manage and learn more about the information used to personalize your Yahoo experience.
Exclusions: Our Chat services described here do not include customer service chatbots or other interfaces for Yahoo account information inquiries.
Microsoft Copilot: The Microsoft Copilot chat solution powers Yahoo Chat. Microsoft may ask for your feedback about how the Microsoft Copilot services are performing in Yahoo Chat. Feedback you provide to Microsoft will be used in accordance with their Privacy Statement
Microsoft’s Limited Use: Other than your feedback, Microsoft is limited in its ability to retain and use your information.
