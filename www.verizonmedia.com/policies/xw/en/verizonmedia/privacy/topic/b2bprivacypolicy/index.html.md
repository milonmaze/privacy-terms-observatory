Yahoo offers business-to-business advertising, analytics, content, and measurement services through products like Flurry and Yahoo Native Marketplace (the “Yahoo B2B Services”). The Yahoo Privacy Policy applies to the collection, use, storage, sharing and retention of your personal data associated with your B2B account with us (“Enterprise Account”).

This Yahoo B2B Privacy Policy (“B2B Privacy Policy”) provides further details into our practices relating to the processing of data associated with your Enterprise Account when you use our Yahoo B2B Services. In the event of a conflict between this B2B Privacy Policy and the Yahoo Privacy Policy, this B2B Privacy Policy prevails.

If you have separate contractual agreements with us concerning our collection, use, or disclosure of your Enterprise Account data, those agreements control and supersede anything stated in this B2B Privacy Policy.

What type of data does Yahoo collect and how do we use it?
How do you manage your data subject rights?

Our Yahoo B2B Services give you various controls to manage certain aspects of your Enterprise Account. However, the platform that we provide to our consumers to manage and control their use of personal data does not work for Enterprise Accounts. If you would like to exercise certain data subject rights regarding your Enterprise Accounts, such as account erasure, please complete our Privacy Form.
