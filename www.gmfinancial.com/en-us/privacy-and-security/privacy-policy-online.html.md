Collecting this information helps us provide you with a better online experience.
User Preferences: We may use cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons to store preferences you demonstrate on the Site. For instance, we may use a cookie to store your email address so that you do not need to re-enter it every time you visit MyAccount or Mode.
Marketing: We may use cookies and web beacons from third-party service providers for marketing purposes to place GM Financial advertisements on nonaffiliated websites. We may also use service providers who use tracking devices such as cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons to collect anonymized information about consumers’ activities on nonaffiliated websites. The information they collect typically includes things like browser type, IP address, pages visited, and time visited. GM Financial may use this information to provide relevant marketing content to you. You may opt out of receiving such advertisements on the advertisement itself. You may be able to opt out of some third-party service providers’ use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Opt-Out page.

One of the third-party services that we use is Google Analytics, which is a web analysis service provided by Google. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the Site and may share this data with other Google services. We also use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third-party websites. Google may show GM Financial advertisements on websites across the internet and may use cookies to serve advertisements based on your past visits to the Site. You can find information about how to opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting Google's Ads Settings.

The Site may also include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, and other widgets, such as the “Share” button or interactive miniprograms provided by third parties. These third parties may use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Site. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.

Do Not Track

Certain web browsers may provide an option by which you may have the browser inform websites or internet services you visit that you do not wish to have your activities tracked by cookies or other persistent identifiers across time and across third-party internet websites, online or cloud computing services, online applications, or mobile applications. These are commonly called "Do Not Track" signals. At this time, the Site does not honor Do Not Track signals from web browsers because it may diminish the optimal performance of the Site. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about cookies and other technologies, and how to manage their use. If you do elect to refuse or delete cookies, you will need to repeat this process if you use another computer or change browsers. If you choose to decline cookies, some of the functionalities of websites may be impaired.

 
Security

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect against loss or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information you provide on the Site. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage technology is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. The security of your information also depends on the security of the electronic devices and internet service provider network that you use to access the Site. We are not responsible for the security of your information accessed on those devices or networks.

 
Mobile Applications

We may offer you the ability to access your GM Financial account on your mobile devices via the GM Financial My Account Mobile Application (“My Account App”). When you use the My Account App or the Mode Mobile Application, we may collect information described in the section above, titled Collecting Personal Information. We may also collect information about your mobile device, device settings, screen resolution, information about your location, and analytical information about how you use your mobile device. Some mobile devices may allow you to limit the sharing of personal information collected by applications that run on those devices, or information collected by the devices themselves. We may ask permission before collecting certain information (such as precise geo-location information) through the My Account App or the Mode Mobile Application.

For your convenience, you may be able to use biometric authentication (using Touch ID, Fingerprint, or Face ID) provided through your mobile device manufacturer to access your GM Financial account. (Please refer to your mobile device manufacturer’s product information for details on biometric functionality for your device.) To enable biometric authentication for logging into the My Account App or the Mode Mobile Application, you are required to save your email address and GM Financial password on your device. GM Financial does not control the fingerprint, Touch ID or Face ID functionality. GM Financial does not have access to your fingerprint(s) or facial recognition information. You understand and agree that any fingerprint or facial recognition information stored on this device can be used to access your GM Financial customer account information. We recommend that you employ a strong device password as an additional layer of security.

 
Children’s Privacy

The Site is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 years, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 years. Please contact us if you believe we may have unknowingly collected information about a child under 13, and we will take immediate steps to delete any such personal information.

 
Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we do, we will post the revised version on this page. You should periodically check here for the most up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will not be retroactively applied and will not alter how we handle any personal information we previously collected from you.
