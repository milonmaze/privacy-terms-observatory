A. Notification to GPC of An Error on Your Google Pay Transaction or GPB Card Transaction Subject To This Section 5 - EFT Error Resolution Policy

In the event that you think that there is an error in your Google Pay transaction or GPB Card transaction subject to this Section 5 – EFT Error Resolution Policy, or you have questions or need more information about that Google Pay transaction or GPB Card transaction, please contact us via our Contact Us page, by using one of these forms, or by calling 1-888-986-7944.

We must hear from you via one of the methods described above no later than 60 days after we made available to you the FIRST statement or other documentation regarding the Google Pay transaction or GPB Card transaction on which the problem or error appeared.

(1) Tell us your name and your email address associated with your Google Pay account.

(2) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.

(3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.

For your GPB Card transaction or your Google Pay Balance funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card, we may extend this 60-day notification period if a delay resulted from your initial attempt to notify the financial institution holding your Funding Account.

If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.

We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will issue a provisional credit to your Google Pay Balance, funds held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or Funding Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.

For errors involving new Google Pay accounts or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new Google Pay accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to issue a provisional credit to your Google Pay Balance, funds held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or Funding Account for the amount you think is in error.

We will tell you the results within 3 business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation by email or U.S. mail. If we had issued a provisional credit to your Google Pay Balance, funds held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or Funding Account for the error, such credit will be reversed and the written explanation will include notice of such reversal. You may ask for copies of the documents that we relied on in making our determination that there was no error.

ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR GPB CARD TRANSACTIONS OR YOUR GOOGLE PAY BALANCE FUNDED FROM YOUR CHECKING OR SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR FROM YOUR DEBIT CARD MUST BE DIRECTED TO US, GPC, AND NOT TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR FUNDING ACCOUNT. We are responsible for the Services and for resolving any errors in your Google Pay transaction subject to this Section 5 – EFT Error Resolution Policy.

IF YOUR GOOGLE PAY ACCOUNT USERNAME AND PASSWORD, OR YOUR GPB CARD PIN IS LOST OR STOLEN, NOTIFY US AT ONCE by calling or writing to us at the telephone number and address indicated above.

B. Unauthorized Payment Transactions

Statement of Your Liability. Please tell us IMMEDIATELY if you believe your Google Pay account username and password or your GPB Card PIN has been lost or stolen. You may contact us via our Contact Us page, by using one of these forms, by calling 1-888-986-7944, or by writing to us at:

Google Payment Corp. – Complaints Handling

P.O. Box 727

Mountain View, CA 94042

Please be aware that you could lose all the money in your Google Pay Balance or held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or your Funding Account.

If you inform us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Google Pay account username and password or your GPB Card PIN, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Google Pay account username and password or GPB Card without your permission. However, if you do NOT inform us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Google Pay account username and password or your GPB Card PIN, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Google Pay account username and password or GPB Card without your permission if you had informed us, you could lose as much as $500.

Also, if your Google Pay account statement shows GPB Card transactions or other transfers that you did not make, please tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.

If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) prevents you from informing us within the 60-day time period, we may extend the time periods.

Contact in event of unauthorized Google Pay account, GPB Card transactions or Google Pay Balance transfers. If you believe your Google Pay account username and password, your GPB Card PIN or your GPB Card has been lost or stolen or that someone has initiated a GPB Card transaction or otherwise transferred money from funds we hold and reflect in your Google Pay account (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or your Google Pay Balance without your permission, contact GPC as indicated above in the "Statement of Your Liability" section.

C. Our Liability to You For Errors Involving Google Pay Transactions or GPB Card Transactions Subject To This Section 5 - EFT Error Resolution Policy

If we do not complete a Google Pay transaction or GPB Card transaction subject to this Section 5 – EFT Error Resolution Policy on time or in the correct amount according to our Terms of Service agreement, we will be liable for your losses or damages to the extent required under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:

(1) If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Google Pay Balance, funds held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or other Payment Method to make the Google Pay transaction or GPB Card transaction.

(2) If, through no fault of ours, a merchant refuses to accept your GPB Card or honor a transaction using your Google Pay Balance or other Payment Method.

(3) The merchant authorizes an amount greater than the purchase amount.

(4) If the Service was not working properly and you knew about the problem with the Service when you started the Google Pay transaction or GPB Card transaction.

(5) If the transaction information supplied by you or a third party is incorrect or untimely.

(6) If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent us from completing the Google Pay transaction or GPB Card transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.

(7) If access to or use of your GPB Card has been blocked after you reported your GPB Card PIN lost or stolen.

(8) If there is a hold or your funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting their use; or

(9) If we have reason to believe the requested transaction is unauthorized.

There may be other exceptions set forth in the Google Pay/Google Payments Additional Terms of Service (U.S.), this Customer Service and Error Resolution Policy or our other agreements with you.

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED ABOVE OR AS PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL GPC BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES FOR DELAY, NONDELIVERY, NONPAYMENT OR UNDERPAYMENT OF A PAYMENT TRANSACTION, WHETHER CAUSED BY AN ACT OR OMISSION OF GPC, ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR OTHERWISE.
