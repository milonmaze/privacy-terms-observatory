CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ERROR RESOLUTION POLICY

FOR

GOOGLE PAY ACCOUNT TRANSACTIONS

Applicability: This Google Pay Customer Service and Error Resolution Policy for Google Pay Account Transactions("Policy") applies to Person-to-Person/Peer-to-Peer Payment Transactions (“P2P Payments”), Google Pay Balance Card (“GPB Card”) transactions and other Google Pay account transactions (which transactions are collectively referred to as “Services” in this Policy) affecting a Google Pay user (“Customer”). These Services are provided to you by Google Payment Corp. ("GPC").

This Policy does not apply to transactions with the Processing Service for Third Parties or other Google Pay features. This Policy also does not apply to Google Pay features or other services provided to you by Google affiliates of GPC. Please see the Google Pay/Google Payments Additional Terms of Service (U.S.) for information relating to these features or other services.

For purposes of these disclosures, the business days of GPC are Monday through Friday. Holidays are not included as business days.

Capitalized terms used in this Policy have the meanings stated in the Google Pay/Google Payments Additional Terms of Service (U.S.), unless otherwise defined in this Policy.

Section 1. Cancellation or Refunds Generally

Except as stated in the "Cancellation or Refunds of P2P Payments" section and the "EFT Error Resolution Policy" section below, all payments processed through the Services are non-refundable to you. You may not use the Services to reverse, chargeback or cancel a completed payment transaction using the Services.

Section 2. Rights With Your Account Holding Financial Institution

In addition to the rights you have under this Policy, you also may have refund or other rights under your agreement with the financial institution holding your Funding Account. You would need to contact your financial institution and/or review your agreement with the financial institution governing your Funding Account for more information.

Section 3. Disputes Between Customers Or With Merchants

Customers are solely responsible for disputes between Customers, and GPC is not a party to and will not be responsible for any disputes between Customers. Customers are solely responsible for disputes with merchants, and GPC is not a party to and will not be responsible for any disputes between a Customer and a merchant.

Section 4. Cancellation or Refunds of P2P Payments

If you send money to a Recipient from your Google Pay Balance or your Funding Account, except for instant transfers and P2P Payments to a Recipient who does not have a qualifying Google Pay account, GPC generally will use commercially reasonable efforts to make funds available to the Recipient no later than three (3) business days after GPC receives final settlement of your funding transaction. A requested P2P Payment is complete when funds are (i) credited to the Recipient’s Google Pay Balance or reflected in the Recipient’s Google Pay account interface, and are available for use or withdrawal by the Recipient or (ii) directed by the Recipient to the Recipient's bank account (via the Recipient's debit card or the ACH network).

The Recipient must download the Google Pay mobile app and have a qualifying Google Payments account in good standing in order for the funds resulting from the P2P Payment to become available to him or her. If you wish to send a P2P Payment to a Recipient who does not have a qualifying Google Pay account, an invitation will be sent to the Recipient to create a Google Pay account in order to, among other things, accept and receive the P2P Payment from you. Such a Recipient may be required to take certain other actions, such as providing GPC with additional registration information, or accepting the Google Pay/Google Payments Additional Terms of Service (U.S.), in order for the P2P Payment request to be completed. GPC is not responsible if the intended Recipient does not have or create such accounts necessary or take any other actions required to receive a P2P Payment. If the intended Recipient does not take the required actions needed to complete the P2P Payment request, the funds will be refunded to the Google Pay Balance or Funding Account you designated to fund the transaction to the extent possible, minus applicable fees to the extent permitted by applicable law.

The Sender may request that GPC cancel the P2P Payment prior to completion of the P2P Payment as described above in this Section. The Sender may request cancellation of the P2P Payment by contacting GPC via our Contact Us page, by using one of these forms, or by calling 1-888-986-7944. GPC will use commercially reasonable efforts to cancel the P2P Payment upon request by the Sender. In the event that GPC is able to cancel the P2P Payment, the funds will be credited to the Sender’s Funding Account or Google Pay Balance that was used to fund the P2P Payment to the extent possible. GPC may deduct applicable fees from the recredited funds, to the extent permitted by applicable law. P2P Payments that have been completed as set forth in this Section are ineligible for cancellation.

Section 5. EFT Error Resolution Policy

This Section 5 - EFT Error Resolution Policy only applies to Google Pay transactions and P2P Payments subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. In particular, we apply this Section 5 - EFT Error Resolution Policy to:

Error claims by consumer Recipients of P2P Payments;

A. Notification to GPC of An Error on Your Google Pay Transaction, GPB Card Transaction or with a P2P Payment Subject To This Section 5 - EFT Error Resolution Policy

In the event that you think that there is an error in your Google Pay transaction, GPB Card transaction or P2P Payment subject to this Section 5 – EFT Error Resolution Policy, or you have questions or need more information about that Google Pay transaction, GPB Card transaction or P2P Payment, please contact us via our Contact Us page, by using one of these forms, or by calling 1-888-986-7944.

We must hear from you via one of the methods described above no later than 60 days after we made available to you the FIRST statement or other documentation regarding the Google Pay transaction, GPB Card transaction or P2P Payment on which the problem or error appeared.

(1) Tell us your name and your email address associated with your Google Pay account.

(2) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.

(3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.

For your P2P Payments funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card, this 60-day notification period is extended to 90 days after the transmittal by the financial institution holding your Funding Account of the FIRST periodic statement on which the funding transaction appeared. For your P2P Payments, GPB Card transaction or your Google Pay Balance funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card, we may extend this 60-day notification period (or 90-day notification period for your P2P Payment funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card) if a delay resulted from your initial attempt to notify the financial institution holding your Funding Account.

If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.

We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will issue a provisional credit to your Google Pay Balance, funds held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or Funding Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.

For errors involving new Google Pay accounts or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new Google Pay accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to issue a provisional credit to your Google Pay Balance, funds held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or Funding Account for the amount you think is in error.

We will tell you the results within 3 business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation by email or U.S. mail. If we had issued a provisional credit to your Google Pay Balance, funds held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or Funding Account for the error, such credit will be reversed and the written explanation will include notice of such reversal. You may ask for copies of the documents that we relied on in making our determination that there was no error.

ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT P2P PAYMENTS YOU HAVE SENT, YOUR GPB CARD TRANSACTIONS OR YOUR GOOGLE PAY BALANCE FUNDED FROM YOUR CHECKING OR SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR FROM YOUR DEBIT CARD MUST BE DIRECTED TO US, GPC, AND NOT TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR FUNDING ACCOUNT. We are responsible for the Services and for resolving any errors in your Google Pay transaction or P2P Payment subject to this Section 5 – EFT Error Resolution Policy.

We will not send you a periodic statement listing P2P Payments you have sent funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card. These transactions will appear only on the statement issued by the financial institution holding your Funding Account. SAVE THE RECEIPTS YOU ARE GIVEN WHEN YOU SEND A P2P PAYMENT FUNDED FROM YOUR CHECKING OR SAVINGS ACCOUNT OR FROM YOUR DEBIT CARD, AND CHECK THEM AGAINST THE ACCOUNT STATEMENT YOU RECEIVE FROM THE INSTITUTION HOLDING YOUR FUNDING ACCOUNT. If you have any questions about one of these P2P Payments, call or write us at the telephone number and address indicated above.

IF YOUR GOOGLE PAY ACCOUNT USERNAME AND PASSWORD, OR YOUR GPB CARD PIN IS LOST OR STOLEN, NOTIFY US AT ONCE by calling or writing to us at the telephone number and address indicated above.

B. Unauthorized Payment Transactions

Statement of Your Liability. Please tell us IMMEDIATELY if you believe your Google Pay account username and password or your GPB Card PIN has been lost or stolen. You may contact us via our Contact Us page, by using one of these forms, by calling 1-888-986-7944, or by writing to us at:

Google Payment Corp. – Complaints Handling

P.O. Box 727

Please be aware that you could lose all the money in your Google Pay Balance or held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or your Funding Account. For your P2P Payments funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card, this 2-day business day notification period is extended to 4 business days.

If you inform us within 2 business (or 4 business days for your P2P Payment funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card) days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Google Pay account username and password or your GPB Card PIN, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Google Pay account username and password or GPB Card without your permission. However, if you do NOT inform us within 2 business days (or 4 business days for your P2P Payment funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card) after you learn of the loss or theft of your Google Pay account username and password or your GPB Card PIN, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Google Pay account username and password or GPB Card without your permission if you had informed us, you could lose as much as $500.

Also, if your Google Pay account statement shows P2P Payments, GPB Card transactions or other transfers that you did not make, please tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days (or 90 days for your P2P Payment funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card) after the statement was made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days (or 90 days for your P2P Payment funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card) if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.

If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) prevents you from informing us within the 60-day (or 90-day for your P2P Payment funded from your checking or savings account or from your debit card) time period, we may extend the time periods.

Contact in event of unauthorized Google Pay account, GPB Card transactions or Google Pay Balance transfers. If you believe your Google Pay account username and password, your GPB Card PIN or your GPB Card has been lost or stolen or that someone has initiated a P2P Payment, GPB Card transaction or otherwise transferred money from funds we hold and reflect in your Google Pay account (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or your Google Pay Balance without your permission, contact GPC as indicated above in the "Statement of Your Liability" section.

C. Our Liability to You For Errors Involving Google Pay Transactions, GPB Card Transactions or P2P Payments Subject To This Section 5 - EFT Error Resolution Policy  

If we do not complete a Google Pay transaction, GPB Card transaction or P2P Payment subject to this Section 5 – EFT Error Resolution Policy on time or in the correct amount according to our Terms of Service agreement, we will be liable for your losses or damages to the extent required under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:

(1) If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Google Pay Balance, funds held by us and reflected in your Google Pay account interface (if no activated Google Pay Balance) or other Payment Method to make the Google Pay transaction, GPB Card transaction or P2P Payment.

(2) If, through no fault of ours, a merchant refuses to accept your GPB Card or honor a transaction using your Google Pay Balance or other Payment Method.

(6) If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent us from completing the Google Pay transaction, GPB Card transaction or P2P Payment, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.

(7) If access to or use of your GPB Card has been blocked after you reported your GPB Card PIN lost or stolen.

(8) If there is a hold or your funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting their use; or

(9)  If we have reason to believe the requested transaction is unauthorized.

There may be other exceptions set forth in the Google Pay/Google Payments Additional Terms of Service (U.S.), this Customer Service and Error Resolution Policy or our other agreements with you.

DISCLAIMER OF ANY OTHER LIABILITY. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED ABOVE OR AS PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL GPC BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES FOR DELAY, NONDELIVERY, NONPAYMENT OR UNDERPAYMENT OF A PAYMENT TRANSACTION, WHETHER CAUSED BY AN ACT OR OMISSION OF GPC, ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR OTHERWISE. THE SOLE REMEDY AGAINST GPC SHALL BE LIMITED TO REFUND TO CUSTOMER OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE PAYMENT TRANSACTION AMOUNT PLUS FEES AND CHARGES, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY LAW.
