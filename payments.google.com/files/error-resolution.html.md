CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ERROR RESOLUTION POLICY

FOR

GOOGLE PAY ACCOUNT TRANSACTIONS
AND

BILL PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

Applicability: This Google Pay Customer Service and Error Resolution Policy for Google Pay Account Transactions and Bill Payment Transactions ("Policy") applies to Person-to-Person/Peer-to-Peer Payment Transactions (“P2P Payments”), Google Pay Balance Card (“GPB Card”) transactions, Bill Payment transactions (“Bill Payments”) and other Google Pay account transactions (which transactions are collectively referred to as “Services” in this Policy) affecting a Google Pay user (“Customer”). These Services are provided to you by Google Payment Corp. ("GPC").

This Policy does not apply to transactions with the Processing Service for Third Parties or other Google Pay features. This Policy also does not apply to Google Pay features or other services provided to you by Google affiliates of GPC. Please see the Google Pay/Google Payments Additional Terms of Service (U.S.) for information relating to these features or other services.

For purposes of these disclosures, the business days of GPC are Monday through Friday. Holidays are not included as business days.

Capitalized terms used in this Policy have the meanings stated in the Google Pay/Google Payments Additional Terms of Service (U.S.), unless otherwise defined in this Policy.

Section 1. Cancellation or Refunds Generally

Except as stated in the "Cancellation or Refunds of P2P Payments" section, the “Refunds of Bill Payments” section and the "EFT Error Resolution Policy" section below, all payments processed through the Services are non-refundable to you. You may not use the Services to reverse, chargeback or cancel a completed payment transaction using the Services.

Section 2. Rights With Your Account Holding Financial Institution

In addition to the rights you have under this Policy, you also may have refund or other rights under your agreement with the financial institution holding your Funding Account. You would need to contact your financial institution and/or review your agreement with the financial institution governing your Funding Account for more information.

Section 3. Disputes Between Customers Or With Merchants

Customers are solely responsible for disputes between Customers, and GPC is not a party to and will not be responsible for any disputes between Customers. Customers are solely responsible for disputes with merchants, and GPC is not a party to and will not be responsible for any disputes between a Customer and a merchant.

Section 4. Cancellation or Refunds of P2P Payments

If you send money to a Recipient from your Google Pay Balance or your Funding Account, except for instant transfers and P2P Payments to a Recipient who does not have a qualifying Google Pay account, GPC generally will use commercially reasonable efforts to make funds available to the Recipient no later than three (3) business days after GPC receives final settlement of your funding transaction. A requested P2P Payment is complete when funds are (i) credited to the Recipient’s Google Pay Balance or reflected in the Recipient’s Google Pay account interface, and are available for use or withdrawal by the Recipient or (ii) directed by the Recipient to the Recipient's bank account (via the Recipient's debit card or the ACH network).

The Recipient must download the Google Pay mobile app and have a qualifying Google Payments account in good standing in order for the funds resulting from the P2P Payment to become available to him or her. If you wish to send a P2P Payment to a Recipient who does not have a qualifying Google Pay account, an invitation will be sent to the Recipient to create a Google Pay account in order to, among other things, accept and receive the P2P Payment from you. Such a Recipient may be required to take certain other actions, such as providing GPC with additional registration information, or accepting the Google Pay/Google Payments Additional Terms of Service (U.S.), in order for the P2P Payment request to be completed. GPC is not responsible if the intended Recipient does not have or create such accounts necessary or take any other actions required to receive a P2P Payment. If the intended Recipient does not take the required actions needed to complete the P2P Payment request, the funds will be refunded to the Google Pay Balance or Funding Account you designated to fund the transaction to the extent possible, minus applicable fees to the extent permitted by applicable law.

The Sender may request that GPC cancel the P2P Payment prior to completion of the P2P Payment as described above in this Section. The Sender may request cancellation of the P2P Payment by contacting GPC via our Contact Us page, by using one of these forms, or by calling 1-888-986-7944. GPC will use commercially reasonable efforts to cancel the P2P Payment upon request by the Sender. In the event that GPC is able to cancel the P2P Payment, the funds will be credited to the Sender’s Funding Account or Google Pay Balance that was used to fund the P2P Payment to the extent possible. GPC may deduct applicable fees from the recredited funds, to the extent permitted by applicable law. P2P Payments that have been completed as set forth in this Section are ineligible for cancellation.

Section 5. Cancellation or Refunds of Bill Payments

GPC cannot assist with a stop payment request for any scheduled Bill Payment transaction using a Payment Method that is a credit card; in such case, you must contact your credit card issuer directly.

The following applies only to a bill payment which is a Recurring Payment using a Payment Method that is a debit card or that debits or charges your bank account (automated clearing house payment (ACH)-enabled). You can stop payment by calling us at 1-855-870-2997, or writing us at Google, Nest Renew 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043 in time for us to receive your request at least three (3) business days or more before the scheduled date of the Bill Payment transaction. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after your call, and your oral stop payment order will cease to be binding after the 14 day period if you fail to provide the requested written confirmation. If you order us to stop payment of a Bill Payment transaction three (3) business days or more before the payment is scheduled, and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages. GPC will not be able to stop payment of a Bill Payment transaction which has cleared at the time GPC receives your stop payment request. GPC also may not be able to stop payment if it does not have a reasonable opportunity to act on your stop payment request before the Bill Payment transaction has been processed.
