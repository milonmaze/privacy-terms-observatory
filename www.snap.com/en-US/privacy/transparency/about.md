About Transparency Reporting
July 1, 2021 – December 31, 2021

Throughout this Transparency Report, we highlight how we enforce safety and privacy across our platform. Beyond simply reporting our data, here we provide additional context and insight into our safety principles, policies, and practices, as well as links to various safety and privacy resources.

History of Snap’s Transparency Reporting

Since 2015, we have produced Transparency Reports that provide important insight into the volume and nature of government requests for Snapchatters' account information and other legal notifications.

Since November 15, 2015, our policy has been to notify Snapchatters when we receive legal process seeking their account information, with exceptions for cases where we are legally prohibited from doing so, or when we believe exceptional circumstances exist (like child sexual exploitation or an imminent risk of death or serious bodily injury).

In 2020, we enhanced our Transparency Report to provide insights into the volume and nature of accounts reported on Snapchat for violations of our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. We also included country-level breakdowns, available for all countries in a downloadable CSV. In 2021, we expanded our categories to include false information, trademark notices and Violative View Rate.

Additional Safety and Privacy Resources

Snap is committed to developing an ecosystem of safety within our platform. Here are some additional resources that explain and inform our policies, actions, and perspectives on safety and transparency.  

Safety Center

Given that Snap is a platform for 13+ users, we believe it is imperative to inform and engage all users on how to keep the platform safe. With numerous resources, such as our Parent Guide and Community Guidelines, we aim to equip users and their parents with the tools they need to communicate and understand how to be safe on Snapchat.

Community Guidelines

Our Community Guidelines form the foundation of our safety principles and are intended to inform users about responsible use of Snapchat. We routinely assess our Guidelines   as just one way of actively working to help keep Snapchat safe.

In-App Reporting 

While safety teams and advanced AI operate 24/7 to help keep Snapchat safe, we also rely on our users to report concerns. To do so, we offer tools both in-app and online to report content and individuals that violate our policies.  


Here for You

The well-being and safety of our users are paramount to us at Snap. To provide engaging and high-touch resources for our users, we have developed in-app tools like Here for You, which provides proactive in-app support to Snapchatters who may be experiencing a mental health or emotional crisis. 

Privacy Center

At Snap, we make your privacy a priority. We seek to earn your trust every time you use Snapchat, or any of our products—that is why we treat your information differently than most other tech companies. Even though our products are constantly evolving, our privacy principles and strong commitment to user privacy remain unchanged.

Law Enforcement Guide

This guide provides information for law enforcement officials seeking Snapchat account records (i.e., Snapchat user data) from Snap.

Safety & Impact Blog

Launched in April 2021, our blog aims to serve as a helpful resource for the many stakeholders and advocates who are interested in how we work to support the safety, privacy and wellbeing of our Snapchat community.
