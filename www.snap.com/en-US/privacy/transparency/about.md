About Transparency Reporting
January 1, 2023 - June 30, 2023

Throughout this Transparency Report, we highlight how we enforce safety and privacy across our platform. Beyond simply reporting our data, here we provide additional context and insight into our safety principles, policies, and practices, as well as links to various safety and privacy resources.
History of Snap’s Transparency Reporting
Since 2015, we have produced Transparency Reports that provide important insight into the volume and nature of government requests for Snapchatters' account information and other legal notifications.
Since November 2015, our policy has been to notify Snapchatters when we receive legal process seeking their account information, with exceptions for cases where we are legally prohibited from doing so, or when we believe exceptional circumstances exist (like child sexual exploitation or an imminent risk of death or serious bodily injury).
In 2020, we enhanced our Transparency Report to provide insights into the volume and nature of accounts reported on Snapchat for violations of our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. We also included country-level breakdowns, available for all countries in a downloadable CSV. In 2021, we expanded our categories to include false information, trademark notices and Violative View Rate.
We are now in the process of further enhancing our Transparency Report, in line with the requirements of the Digital Services Act. This information will complement the information we already provide in our Transparency Report for H1 2023 and on our EU Transparency Page.
Additional Safety and Privacy Resources
Snap is committed to developing an ecosystem of safety within our platform. Here are some additional resources that explain and inform our policies, actions, and perspectives on safety and transparency.  
Snap’s Transparency Report Explainer Guide
Transparency reports include a lot of information that can sometimes be challenging for parents, caregivers and other stakeholders who care deeply about the safety of our community to fully understand. This explainer guide is designed to help you better understand our latest report and to help you easily compare what’s new this year.
Safety Center
Snapchat is a platform for teens aged 13 and over, and we want to help both users and their parents understand how to use our app safely and critical protections they should be aware of. Our Safety Hub includes insights into our safety policies, a list of safety resources, guidance on how to report concerns on Snapchat, and resources for parents and caregivers. Additionally, it includes information about the Snapchat Family Center, our system of parental controls. 
Community Guidelines
Our Community Guidelines form the foundation of our safety principles and are intended to inform users about responsible use of Snapchat. We routinely assess our Guidelines   as just one way of actively working to help keep Snapchat safe.
In-App Reporting
While safety teams and advanced AI operate 24/7 to help keep Snapchat safe, we also rely on our users to report concerns. To do so, we offer tools both in-app and online to report content and individuals that violate our policies.  
Family Center
Family Center is our in-app parental control tool, which helps parents get more insight into who their teens are friends with on Snapchat, and who they have been communicating with, without revealing any of the substance of those conversations.
Parent’s Guide
This guide is meant to help parents and caregivers understand how Snapchat works, the key protections we offer for teens, how to use our parental controls, and to answer common questions.
Here for You
The well-being and safety of our users are paramount to us at Snap. To provide engaging and high-touch resources for our users, we have developed in-app tools like Here for You, which provides proactive in-app support to Snapchatters who may be experiencing a mental health or emotional crisis. 
Privacy Center
At Snap, we make your privacy a priority. We seek to earn your trust every time you use Snapchat, or any of our products—that is why we treat your information differently than most other tech companies. Even though our products are constantly evolving, our privacy principles and strong commitment to user privacy remain unchanged.
Law Enforcement Guide
This guide provides information for law enforcement officials seeking Snapchat account records (i.e., Snapchat user data) from Snap.
Safety & Impact Blog
Launched in April 2021, our blog aims to serve as a helpful resource for the many stakeholders and advocates who are interested in how we work to support the safety, privacy and wellbeing of our Snapchat community.
