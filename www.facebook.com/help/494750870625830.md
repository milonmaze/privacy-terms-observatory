How does Facebook work with data providers?
Copy link
This page used to contain a list of the third-party data providers that Facebook worked with to offer their targeting segments directly on Facebook, and a description of that programme. After we last updated our Data Policy (in April 2018), we terminated this programme. Facebook no longer works with third-party data providers to offer their targeting segments directly on Facebook.
Businesses may continue, on their own, to work with data providers. Many businesses today work with third parties to help manage and understand their marketing efforts. For example, a car dealer may want to customise an offer to people who are likely to be interested in buying a new car. The dealer may also want to send offers, such as discounts for service, to customers that have purchased a car from them. To do this, the car dealer works with a third-party company to identify and reach those customers with the right offer.
So businesses who advertise to you may be using a list of people that they've received, or received the ability to use, from third parties that they work with for their marketing efforts. Businesses that advertise on Facebook are required to have any necessary rights and permissions to use this information, as outlined in our Custom Audience Terms that businesses must agree to.
