Browser settings

Dropbox websites and services recognize and respect some browser-enabled opt-out signals, such as the Global Privacy Control. Additionally there are other ways to set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use our services. Due to a lack of an agreed upon standard for interpreting Do Not Track (DNT) signals, our systems currently don’t respond to DNT:1 signals from browsers visiting our websites.
