These Terms govern your use of the websites that link to these Terms. In these Terms, the word “Sites” refers to each of these websites and the services offered on those Sites. You automatically agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Statement simply by using or logging into the Sites.

Please note that we offer many services. Your use of Salesforce products or services are provided by Salesforce pursuant to a separate manually or digitally-executed agreement. Those additional terms become part of your agreement with us, if you use the services or log into the Sites.

A. Your Accounts

You may be required to create an account and specify a password in order to use certain services or features on the Sites. To create an account, you must be at least 18 years old and you must provide truthful and accurate information about yourself. Don’t try to impersonate anyone else when you create your account. If your information changes at any time, please update your account to reflect those changes.

In some cases, an account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using or logging into an account assigned to you by an administrator, additional terms may apply to your use of the Sites. Moreover, your administrator may be able to access or disable your account without our involvement.

You may not share your account with anyone else. Please keep your password confidential, and try not to use it on other websites. If you believe that your account has been compromised at any time, please notify your system administrator.
