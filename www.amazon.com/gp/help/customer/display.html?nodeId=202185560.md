Children's Privacy Disclosure
Last updated: July 8, 2020



Children's privacy is important to Amazon. This disclosure and the Amazon Privacy Notice describe how we handle personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 ("child" or "children").

What Personal Information Does Amazon Collect From Children?

We offer some services intended for children, and in some cases we may know a child is using our services (for example, when using a child profile). In these situations, children may share and we may collect personal information that requires verifiable parental consent under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (collectively, "Child Personal Information"). Child Personal Information could include, for example, name, birthdate, contact information (including phone numbers and e-mail addresses), voice, photos, videos, location, and certain activity and device information and identifiers (such as cookies, device serial numbers, and IP addresses). Our Privacy Notice describes other information we collect that is not Child Personal Information.

How Does Amazon Use Child Personal Information?

We use Child Personal Information to provide and improve our products and services, including personalizing offerings and recommendations for children, communicating information, enforcing parental controls, and giving parents visibility into how their children use our products and services. We will not serve interest-based ads to your child when they are using an Amazon child profile.

Does Amazon Share Child Personal Information?

We share Child Personal Information only as described in our Privacy Notice. Your child may be able to share information publicly and with others depending on the products and services used.

What Choices Do I Have?

You choose whether to give us permission to collect Child Personal Information from your child. If you have not given us permission to collect Child Personal Information, we may make available certain voice services intended for children (e.g., certain Alexa features), and we may process your child’s voice recordings to provide these services, but we will not store those voice recordings. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Child Personal Information without this permission.

We make available controls so that you can remain involved in your child's use of Amazon services. To learn more about revoking permission for a child or how to review or delete Child Personal Information, please visit the Manage Parental Consent page or contact Customer Service using the information provided below.

Please note that if you withdraw the permission you have provided for your child or request deletion of Child Personal Information, certain services and features may no longer be available.

What About Information Collected By Third Parties?

This disclosure does not apply to the practices of any third-party services (including apps, skills, and websites) that may be accessed through an Amazon product or service. Before using any third-party service, you should review the applicable terms and policies to determine their appropriateness for your child, including the service’s data collection and use practices.
