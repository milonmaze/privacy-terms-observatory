AT&T Privacy Policy

Your information and your privacy are important â€” to you and to us. This policy explains how we use your information and how we keep it safe.

Most importantly, it explains the choices you can make at any time about how your information is used.

When this Policy applies

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers the information generated when you use or subscribe to AT&T products, services, apps, websites or networks to which this policy is linked. In the Policy, we call them “Products or Services” for short. They include voice, data, internet and other products, services and apps.

This Policy applies to you and anyone who uses our Products or Services under your account, except where we identify for you that separate AT&T privacy policies or terms and conditions apply. You are responsible for making sure all users under your account understand and agree to this Policy.

Here are special circumstances where this Policy may not apply, or may apply in addition to other policies:
Some of our Products or Services — for example our FirstNet service — may be covered by their own privacy policies or additional privacy terms and conditions, while, U-verse TV is governed by the DIRECTV privacy policy.
Some of our affiliates — such as DIRECTV and Cricket — have their own privacy policies that apply to data they collect from products, services and apps they provide. Any data collected subject to this Policy that is shared with those affiliates will still be protected consistent with this Policy.
Some areas both inside and outside of the United States — for example California and the European Union — require us to adopt different policy terms and commitments in accordance with local laws.
In certain cases, when you’re using your AT&T Products or Services, other companies may be collecting information, so that your information may be covered by this Policy and other privacy policies at the same time. Here are some examples: if you purchase one of our Products or Services from a retailer; if you use our Services to connect to a social networking service or another company’s Wi-Fi network; or if you provide your information to another company through a co-branded website, app or service controlled by the other company. In those cases, any information you provide to those companies may be subject to just their policy, or subject to both their policy and ours.
If you are an AT&T business customer, we may have written Product or Service agreements that contain specific provisions about confidentiality, security or handling of information. When one of those agreements differs from or conflicts with this Policy, the terms of those agreements will apply instead.
The information we collect

We collect information about you and how you’re using our Products or Services along with information about your devices and equipment. This may include performance information, along with web browsing, location and video viewing information.

Here are detailed examples of types of information we collect from our Products or Services:
Account Information: includes things like contact and billing information, service-related details and history and similar information, including Customer Proprietary Network Information. It also includes technical, equipment and usage information that relate to the services, products, websites and networks we provide you.
Web browsing and app information includes things like the websites you visit or mobile apps you use. We use pixels, cookies, and similar technologies, and collect information on and off our network. We do not decrypt information you transmit using a secure website or app — including sensitive data like passwords or your banking information. We collect information including internet protocol and website address, and identifiers like advertising IDs and device IDs. This may also include information about the time you spend on websites or apps, the links or advertisements you see, the videos you watch online using our mobility and broadband services, search terms you enter, and items in your online shopping cart. We use this information together with data from testing and running our network.
Equipment Information includes information that identifies or relates to equipment on our networks, such as type, identifier, status, settings, configuration, software or use.
Network performance and usage information includes information about our networks, including your use of Products or Services or equipment on the networks, and how they are performing.
Location Information includes your street address, your ZIP code and where your device is located. Location information is generated when the devices, Products or Services you use interact with cell towers, Wi-Fi routers, Bluetooth services, access points, other devices, beacons and/or with other technologies, including GPS satellites.
Biometric Information such as unique biological pattern or characteristic or other unique physical or digital representation of biometric data, like a fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of face geometry, that is used to identify a specific individual. To learn more, see AT&T’s Biometric Information Privacy Notice.
How we collect your information
We collect your information in 3 ways:
You give it to us when you make a purchase, set up an account or otherwise directly communicate with us.
We automatically get it when you use, or your device uses, our Products or Services. For example, we use network tools to collect information like call and text records and the web browsing information we describe in this Policy.
We get it from outside sources like credit reports, marketing mailing lists, and commercially available geographic and demographic information, along with other available information, such as public posts to social networking sites.
How we use your information

We use your information, together with the information from testing and running our network, to power our services and to improve your experiences. This information is used to provide, support, improve, protect, analyze and bill for our products, service and network; to communicate with you about your service, products or apps; to better understand how you use our products and services; to market our services; to detect and avoid fraud; for advertising; and for research.

How we share your information
We share it with your permission.
We share it across AT&T companies.
We share it with non-AT&T companies or entities as explained in this Policy. For more details about how your information may be shared for advertising and marketing see Privacy Choices and Controls.
Sharing information across the AT&T affiliates

Like many large companies, AT&T is made up of many affiliates. Our Products and Services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share information that may identify you personally internally among
our affiliatesButton Icon, such as DIRECTV and Cricket. For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share and protect the information consistent with this Policy including honoring your communications preferences for first-party marketing of their products and services, your advertising consents and your California Data Rights. We may also combine information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.

Sharing information with non-AT&T companies that provide services for us or for you

We share information that identifies you personally with vendors that perform services for us or that support Products or Services provided to you, including marketing or ad delivery services. We do not require consent for sharing with our vendors for these purposes. We do not allow those vendors to use your information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy.

Sharing information with non-AT&T companies to enable third party services to you

We may share information with non-AT&T companies for their purposes to provide you services such as verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting fraud, protecting your financial accounts, and authorizing transactions. We do not allow those non-AT&T companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy. You are in control of this sharing. If you’re an AT&T Prepaid customer, text“STOP” to 8010 to stop sharing with third party services or“RESUME” to restart sharing at any time. Other customers can opt out by Managing Your Privacy Choices.

Sharing information with other non-AT&T companies or entities

There are also times when we provide information that identifies you personally to other companies and entities, such as government agencies, credit bureaus and collection agencies, without your consent, but where authorized or required by law. Reasons to share include:

Complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies, as well as parties to civil lawsuits. You can find out more about this in our Transparency Report.
Detecting and preventing fraud.
Providing or obtaining payment for your service.
Routing your calls or other communications.
Ensuring network operations and security.
Notifying, responding or providing information (including location information) to a responsible governmental entity in emergency circumstances or in situations involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.
Alerting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our services. 
Enforcing our legal rights, protecting our network and property or defending against legal claims.
Complying with legal requirements to share the names, addresses and telephone numbers of non-mobile phone customers with phone directory publishers and directory assistance services. We honor your request for non-published or non-listed numbers.
Providing name and number information for wireline and wireless CallerID and related services, like Call Trace. This means a person receiving a call can see the name and number of the caller.
Sharing Metrics Reports with non-AT&T companies

Sometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. For example, we may be paid by an advertiser to deliver an advertisement or by a business customer to provide its employee with a service. We may also collect information, including location and web browsing data, from visitors to sites where we provide Wi-Fi services. In such cases, we may use or share information that doesn’t identify you personally to provide metrics reports to our business customers and service suppliers. We may also share it with advertising and other companies to deliver or assess the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.

Sharing information for research

We may share information that doesn’t identify you personally with other companies and entities for research.  When we share this information, we require companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to use it to identify individuals.  Our agreements will also prevent businesses from reusing or reselling the information and require that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.

Sharing Aggregate Insights

We may share with third parties insights about AT&T’s operations, network or services derived from aggregated customer data (data grouped so as not to identify you personally).

Sharing information with AT&T affiliates and non-AT&T companies for advertising and marketing programs

We may share information with AT&T affiliates and with non-AT&T companies to deliver or assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns as described in Privacy Choices and Controls.

Sharing information to support location services

Location services rely on, use or incorporate the location of a device to provide or enhance the service. Location services may collect and use or share location information to power applications on your device (those that are pre-loaded or those that you chose to download), such as mapping and traffic apps, or other location services you subscribe to.  AT&T will not share your location information for location services without your consent (to us or a company providing you service), except as required by law.  If you purchase location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device, the use or disclosure of location information is governed by the agreement between you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the service provider, and is not governed by this privacy policy.  In other cases — for example parental controls services - the account holder for the location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the location services and provide the required consent.

Your Privacy Choices and Controls

You can Manage Your Privacy Choices about how we contact you and how we use or share your information. You also have choices about how certain third parties and advertisers use your information, including how we use and share your information for advertising, marketing and analytics.

Communication preferences

Sometimes we have offers or programs that may interest you. We’d like to be able to tell you about these. You can manage how we do it. You can opt-out of marketing and advertising programs, but we still may contact you with service and non-marketing messages.

Email: You can opt-out of marketing emails by using att.com/marketing-unsubscribe.
Text messages: Opt-out of our marketing text messages by replying "stop" to any message.
Consumer telemarketing: Ask to be removed from our consumer telemarketing lists by contacting us at (800) 288.2020 (consumer) or (800) 321.2000 (business), or by sending an e-mail to privacypolicy@att.com. You also can ask the AT&T representative to remove you from our telemarketing lists when you receive a marketing or promotional call from us.
Business telemarketing: Where required by local laws and/or regulations, we’ll remove your business information from our telemarketing lists at your request.
National Do Not Call Registry: The FTC maintains a National Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov, and some states in the United States may maintain their own Do Not Call Registry. Putting your number on these registries also may limit our telemarketing calls.
Automated messages: In some cases, we will ask for your permission to send you automated calls or messages to your mobile phone. To opt-out of these calls or messages from us, go to Manage Your Privacy Choices. As required or allowed by law, even if you opt-out, we may continue to contact you with automated calls or messages at the telephone number issued by us for certain important informational messages about your service. For example, we may need to let you know about a problem with your wireless service.
Postal mail: You can review our Residential Do Not Mail Policy Statement Button Icon and limit postal mail solicitations. You’ll still receive billing statements, legal notices, product updates and other similar correspondence, and you may still receive some promotional mailings.
Choices about how we use and share your information for advertising, marketing and analytics

You have choices about whether your information is used or shared in our programs that provide you with marketing and advertising tailored to your interests and for aggregate analytics.  As your provider of communications and internet services, our collection and use of information operates independently in many cases from the user controls and settings on your device, through your operating system, or on third-party websites or apps.

Online behavioral advertising: Online behavioral advertising is automated, customized advertising that you see when using online services, like ads in mobile apps or on websites. Those ads are served to you based on inferences about your interests.  Those interests are determined from data collected about you, whether by AT&T or other parties.

We work with ad companies that may serve ads for us, and for others, across your use of online services. These companies may use cookies, mobile advertising identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our websites and other websites. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track online activities and deliver ads and content tailored to your interests as part of our advertising programs, such as Relevant Advertising.
You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising from companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by going to their Consumer Choice Page or selecting this icon  when you see it on an online ad.

Relevant Advertising and Enhanced Relevant Advertising: Relevant Advertising and Enhanced Relevant Advertising both use information to deliver ads that we think you might be interested in on websites, video programming, apps and other properties, sites or services. 

Relevant Advertising: This program is used to tailor the ads you see to match your interests. It doesn’t give you more advertisingâ€”it just makes the ads you see more likely to be relevant to you. If you don’t want to receive Relevant Advertising, you may opt-out by going to Manage Your Privacy Choices.
Information we use for Relevant Advertising: As part of this program, we use information about your use of our Products and Services, like information about the apps you use or the websites you visit, your video viewing, or your location. We also use information from companies like our advertising partners. By using demographic information like ZIP code and age range, we may place you into demographic or interest categories like“sports enthusiast” or “coffee lover.” We also use this information to deliver and assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.
Information we don’t use for Relevant Advertising: We don’t use sensitive information — like medical conditions or financial account records — that you share securely. We also don’t use information about the content of webpages you visit or videos you view over a secure internet connection, or the content of your texts, emails or calls.
Information we share in Relevant Advertising: We may share non-sensitive information, such as your device information, information from companies like our advertising partners, and demographic information like your age range, gender and ZIP code.  We may share this information with third parties, such as advertisers, programmers and networks, social media networks, analytics firms, ad networks, and other similar companies that are involved in creating and delivering advertisements.  When we share that information, we combine it with an identifier like a device or ad ID (such as Apple or Android Ad ID).
Information we don’t share in Relevant Advertising: We don’t share information about your individual web browsing or video viewing.  Nor will we share the precise location of your device, Customer Proprietary Network Information, Social Security number, full date of birth, credit card information or driver’s license number. When we share information with third parties, we won’t share your name or identify you by anything other than an identifier, like a device or ad ID.
Enhanced Relevant Advertising: You can opt-in to this program to further personalize the ads you see. With your consent, this program lets us use and share additional information as outlined in the program. In addition, by using information from testing and running our network, we may infer websites visited or videos viewed over a secure connection for advertising and marketing purposes. You can review these terms or Manage Your Privacy Choices.
External Marketing and Analytics:

We may use or share information that does not identify you personally to help our business customers develop aggregate insights that improve their businesses. This information may be combined with other information, such as demographic information or an identifier like a device ID or ad ID. We require that your information be used only to develop aggregate insights that will improve products and services. In addition, we require anyone who receives this data to agree they will only use it for aggregate insights, won’t attempt to identify any person or device using this information, and will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.

If you don’t want your information included in External Marketing and Analytics, you can opt out by going to Manage Your Privacy Choices.

Security

We work hard to safeguard your data using a range of technological and organizational security controls.

We maintain and protect the security of computer storage and network equipment, and we use security procedures that require employees to authenticate themselves to access sensitive data. We also limit access to personal information only to those with jobs requiring such access. We require callers and online users to authenticate themselves before providing account information.

No security measures are perfect, however. We can’t guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy. If a breach were to occur, we will notify you as required by applicable law.

Data storage, transfer, retention and accuracy

We take steps to ensure that data is processed according to this Policy and to the requirements of applicable law of your country and of the additional countries where the data is subsequently processed.

Data we collect may be processed and stored in the United States or in other countries where we or our affiliates or service providers process data.

When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other countries, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to help ensure all applicable laws, rights and regulations continue to protect your data.

We keep your information as long as we need it for business, tax or legal purposes. After that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or indecipherable.

Need to update your information? We’re happy to help you review and correct the information we have on your account and billing records. For more information, please see the Contact Us section of this Policy.

You may review information about the company’s CCPA data requests for the prior calendar year by visiting the CCPA metrics page.

Verification of Identity — Access or Deletion Requests

Password Protected Account. If you maintain a password-protected account with us, in most cases you may submit an access or deletion request by authenticating yourself with a password like you would when you access your account (see exceptions below in the following paragraph). You’ll have to authenticate yourself again to access your data or submit your deletion request.

Former Accountholders, Non-Accountholders (without Password Protected Account) — and also FirstNet, Prepaid and .net accounts. If you do not have a password protected account — or have a FirstNet, prepaid or .net account — we will ask to verify your identity using our mobile verification process. This process captures an image of your identity document, such as your driver’s license, and compares it to a self-photo you submit. We will only use this information to verify your identity. We will delete it after the time expires allowed by the CCPA to process and respond to your request.

If we cannot verify your identity, we will notify you that we will not be able to respond to your request.

You may designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. Your agent will need a valid power of attorney or written permission signed by you. If the agent relies on written permission, we’ll need to verify the agent’s identity. We may also contact you directly to confirm the permission. Your authorized agent can submit your requests by calling us at 866-385-3193.

We Don’t Mind If You Exercise Your California Data Rights

We are committed to providing you with control over your CCPA PI. If you exercise any of these rights explained in this section of the Privacy Policy, we will not disadvantage you. You will not be denied or charged different prices or rates for goods or services or provided a different level or quality of goods or services.

Consumers Under 16 Years Old

As of the effective date of this policy, we do not have actual knowledge that we sell CCPA PI of consumers under 16 years of age. If we collect CCPA PI that we know is from a child under 16 years old in the future, we will not sell that information unless we receive affirmative permission to do so. If a child is between 13 and 16 years of age, the child may provide that permission. 

Any customer who wishes to request further information about our compliance with these requirements, or who has questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies, can email us at privacypolicy@att.com, or write to us at AT&T Privacy Policy, Chief Privacy Office, 208 S. Akard, Room 2100, Dallas, TX 75202.

Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)

CPNI is information about your telecommunications and VoIP (internet phone) services from us, including what plans you subscribe to, how you use these services and details such as who you have called. (Your telephone number, name and address are not considered CPNI.) We use CPNI internally and share it outside AT&T only when conforming with applicable regulations and orders of the Federal Communications Commission.

We do not share CPNI with anyone outside of the AT&T affiliatesButton Icon defined above or our authorized agents or vendors without your consent, with the following authorized exceptions: Court orders; as authorized by law; fraud detection; to provide your service and route your calls; for network operations and security; aggregate (grouped) information and information that doesn’t identify you personally.

We do use your CPNI internally. We may share information about our customers among the AT&T affiliates and our agents to offer new or enhanced services or promotions. We can also use your CPNI for the purpose of turning it into aggregate data or information that does not personally identify you.

It is your right and our duty under federal law to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.

If you don’t want us to use your CPNI internally for things like offers, here is what you can do:

Opt-out at att.com/cpni/optout.
Call us at (800) 315.8303, any time of day, and follow the prompts.
Chat with a service representative at (800) 288.2020 (consumer) or (800) 321.2000 (business).

If you choose to restrict our use of your CPNI, it won’t affect your ability to use any of your services. You can change your mind at any time about letting us use or not use your CPNI. If you restrict your CPNI use, you may still get marketing from us, but it won’t be based on using your CPNI.
