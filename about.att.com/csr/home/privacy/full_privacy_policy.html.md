EFFECTIVE JUNE 19, 2020

This Policy applies to you and anyone who uses our Products or Services under your account, except where we identify for you that separate AT&T privacy policies or terms and conditions apply. You are responsible for making sure all users under your account understand and agree to this Policy.

Security

We work hard to safeguard your data using a range of technological and organizational security controls.

We maintain and protect the security of computer storage and network equipment, and we use security procedures that require employees to authenticate themselves to access sensitive data. We also limit access to personal information only to those with jobs requiring such access. We require callers and online users to authenticate themselves before providing account information.

No security measures are perfect, however. We can’t guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy. If a breach were to occur, we will notify you as required by applicable law.

Data storage, transfer, retention and accuracy

We take steps to ensure that data is processed according to this Policy and to the requirements of applicable law of your country and of the additional countries where the data is subsequently processed.
