Transparency Report

At AT&T, we take our responsibility to protect your information and privacy very seriously. You can learn more by reading our Customer Privacy Issue Brief.

 

 

Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement entities, as well as parties to civil lawsuits, by complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and other legal requirements. This AT&T Transparency Report provides (1) specific data regarding the number and types of legal demands to which we responded for the first half of 2022 that compelled AT&T to provide information about (a) communications or (b) our customers, as well as (2) information permitted by law to be disclosed about Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act demands for the second half of 2021. The Transparency Report also provides information about legal demands that were partially or completely rejected, demands for location information, emergency requests and international legal demands.

In this report, “AT&T” includes all of AT&T’s operating units as of this reporting period:

AT&T Communications1 provides mobile, broadband, and other communications services to U.S.-based consumers and nearly 3 million companies globally — from the smallest business to nearly all the Fortune 1000.
AT&T Mexico offers mobile services to people and businesses in Mexico.

1 On August 2, 2021, we completed our transaction with TPG Capital establishing a new company named, “DIRECTV”. This new company owns and operates the DIRECTV, AT&T TV and U-verse video services previously owned and operated by AT&T. This Report includes data from DIRECTV for the entire reporting period. On April 8, 2022, we completed the transaction with Discovery, Inc. creating a new company "Warner Bros. Discovery Inc." while on June, 2022 we completed the sale of Xandr, Inc. to Microsoft Corporation. Due to those transactions, those companies' data will not be in this or future reports.
