In addition, we share all the categories of your personal information described above with third parties as follows:

7. DATA STORAGE
This website is operated by Columbia Sportswear Company, a company which is headquartered in the United States of America. To provide you with this website and the goods and services you order, your data may be processed by Columbia Sportswear Company, its group companies, and it service providers, who may be located in countries (including the USA) other than your country of residence. These countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws in your country of residence, but Columbia Sportswear Company will protect your personal information in accordance with applicable data protection law and this Policy at all times.
8. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), beginning January 1, 2020 you have certain rights with respect to that information.

Notice of Sales. Note that the CCPA defines “sell” very broadly, and certain sharing activities described above may therefore be considered a sale under California law. For example, we “sell” data to third party analytics, ad tech companies, and affiliate marketers. Third party analytics and ad tech companies may also further sell data to others as described in our Cookie Policy.

Right to Know. You have a right to request that we provide you with the following information:


The categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.


The categories of sources from which we collect personal information.


The purposes for collecting, using, or selling personal information.


The categories of third parties with which we share personal information.


The categories of personal information we have disclosed about you for a business purpose. Note that the CCPA defines “business purpose” broadly; and because we use service providers for a number of business purposes that require access to our systems that hold personal information (such as supplying cloud data storage, maintaining the security of our systems, and providing customer support), in the past 12 months we have disclosed for a business purpose data from all of the categories of personal information that we maintain.


The categories of personal information we have sold about you (if any), for each category of third parties to which the personal information was sold in the past 12 months. Note that the CCPA defines “sell” very broadly, and some of our data sharing with third party analytics and ad tech companies described in this Policy and in our Cookie Policy may be considered a “sale” under that definition. We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.


You may make such a “request to know” by completing the form provided here or by contacting us at 1-866-482-1422 during normal business hours. Note that we have provided much of this information in this Policy.

Right to Delete. You also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to delete, complete the form provided here or contact us at 1-866-482-1422 during normal business hours.

Right to Opt-Out. You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” of personal information. To do so, please see the California Do Not Sell My Info page.

You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us. You have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising rights set out in the CCPA.

In addition, under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, if you are a California customer, you may request information about whether a business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of such a request, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@columbia.com with “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information. Non-affiliated third parties are independent from Columbia and if you wish to receive information about your disclosure choices or stop communications from such third parties, you will need to contact those non-affiliated third parties directly.
9. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND PLUG-INS
The Sites may have links to third-party websites, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the practices of such sites.

The Sites may also offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social media sites, which may allow us and/or the social media site to receive data from or about you. In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social plugin, such as a Twitter Follow button, or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personal information to a third-party operating a plug-in on this Site, then such third-party may recognize you on this Site. Your use of social network plugins is subject to each social media site’s privacy policy, which may be different from ours, so please read these policies carefully to understand their policies and your options. As with linked sites, we have no control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by social network plugins, and are not responsible for the practices of such sites.
10. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
Columbia will change this Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our products, how we use personal information, or the applicable law. When we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the "Last Updated" date above. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will provide notice or obtain consent regarding such changes as may be required by law.
