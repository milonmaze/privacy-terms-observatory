AT&T Access ID and Account Management Terms and Conditions ("Terms")

These Terms are between AT&T Services, Inc., and its affiliates (individually and collectively, "AT&T") and you, an individual. AT&T may modify or amend these Terms at any time, with or without notice to you, by posting a copy of the modified or amended Terms at https://www.att.com/legal/general-policies.html. You agree to the modified or amended Terms if you continue using an AT&T Access ID following the date they are posted.

1. AT&T Access ID and Account Management – General
1.1 

AT&T Access ID is a type of user ID that allows you to establish your online identity, and use that identity to manage multiple AT&T accounts online and/or to use other AT&T and third party services and applications. Account Management includes AT&T's online account management sites known as myAT&T, and any other account management site or functionality that AT&T offers. By creating or using an AT&T Access ID or Account Management, you are agreeing to these Terms, the AT&T Online Terms of Use at https://www.att.com/legal/terms.attWebsiteTermsOfUse.html and the AT&T Privacy Policy at www.att.com/privacy, each as amended from time to time, incorporated by reference, for any and all use of AT&T Access ID or Account Management.

1.2. CONTRACTUAL AGE LIMITATION. 

YOU AGREE THAT AN AT&T ACCESS ID IS NOT TO BE USED BY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN (13). BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE THIRTEEN (13) YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER, AND WILL TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT UNDERAGE MEMBERS OF YOUR ACCOUNT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED IDS, PASSWORDS, OR OTHER LOGIN CREDENTIALS. IF YOU ARE THIRTEEN (13) YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER BUT NOT OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS AND ACCEPT THEM ON YOUR BEHALF.

1.3 

You may use your AT&T Access ID to access a variety of other AT&T and third party services, each with their own terms and conditions ("Related Agreements"). No Related Agreement, however, will limit, encumber, or otherwise restrict AT&T's rights and remedies or your obligations under these Terms, or waive any restrictions on your rights to use an AT&T Access ID. These Terms will not limit, encumber, or otherwise restrict AT&T's rights and remedies or your obligations under any Related Agreement between you and AT&T, or waive any restrictions on your rights under any Related Agreement between you and AT&T.

2. AT&T Access ID – Registration
2.1 

In order to register for AT&T Access ID, you will create your AT&T Access ID and password. AT&T may create an AT&T Access ID for you. While AT&T provides minimum guidelines for creating a password, you are responsible for ensuring the password you create is secure. You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your AT&T Access ID and password(s), and for all activities and use that occur, whether or not with your knowledge, under your AT&T Access ID. AT&T makes no warranty, guarantee, or representation that use of an AT&T Access ID or password is protected from security threats or other vulnerabilities.

2.2 

You will notify AT&T immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your AT&T Access ID or access to your password. For security reasons, AT&T may take any and all action, as it deems necessary or reasonable, including without limitation: suspending access to your accounts and services; disabling your AT&T Access ID; changing your password; or requesting additional information to authorize use of your AT&T Access ID. If AT&T disables your AT&T Access ID, you will be prevented from accessing all of your accounts and services linked to your AT&T Access ID.

2.3 

You will be asked to designate a primary account ("Primary Contact Account"). If you do not have a Primary Contact Account designated, your Primary Contact Account will be designated for you and the Primary Contact Account contact information will be used to send you important notices related to your account, including notice of certain account changes required under the Federal Communications Commission's rules.

3. AT&T Access ID – Profile
3.1 

As part of the registration process, you will be required to provide certain information about yourself and you may be required to complete a profile for the AT&T service you wish to access. You may also provide, store, post, share or display an array of content via your AT&T Access ID or through any other service that you associate with your AT&T Access ID. All information that you provide, whether or not required, is collectively referred to as "Profile Information."

3.2 

You are responsible for your Profile Information and you agree that your Profile Information is and will be kept accurate, correct, and up to date. In order to maintain your use of your AT&T Access ID, it is important that you keep your contact information current, as AT&T may use this contact information to provide important notices to you. Failure to update your contact information may prevent you from receiving important notices. AT&T may, without notice, suspend or terminate your AT&T Access ID and refuse any and all current or future use of an AT&T Access ID if you provide any Profile Information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete.

3.3 

You, or anyone who can access your Profile Information, can review and revise your Profile Information at any time. Under no circumstances will AT&T or its collaborators, suppliers, or licensors be liable in any way for any Profile Information, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Profile Information, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use or transmission of any such Profile Information. AT&T's use and disclosure of any such Profile Information, including use of such Profile Information for targeted advertising, is governed by the AT&T Privacy Policy at att.com/privacy.

3.4 

You grant AT&T and its designees a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sub-licensable and transferable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display your Profile Information, in whole or part, and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed related to AT&T Access ID, Account Management or the services associated with your AT&T Access ID. AT&T is under no obligation to post or use any Profile Information that you may provide, and AT&T may remove your Profile Information at any time in its sole discretion. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all necessary rights, consents and permissions to your Profile Information necessary to submit such material and to grant AT&T all of the license rights granted herein and that such submissions do not violate the privacy, publicity, or contract rights or any intellectual property or other rights of any person.

4. AT&T Access ID – Linking Accounts
4.1 

Once you have created an AT&T Access ID, you have the option of linking additional AT&T accounts to your AT&T Access ID so that you can access those AT&T accounts through your AT&T Access ID. You may also be able to continue accessing those AT&T accounts using your original login ID. Any access to Account Management using a login ID that is not an AT&T Access ID shall be subject to these Terms although not all of the functionality of AT&T Access ID may be available when using another login ID.

4.2 

If the person establishing the AT&T Access ID and linking the AT&T account identifies himself as the person responsible for paying the bill, that person will be designated the "Primary User." The Primary User can grant access rights to another individual, or an individual with personal information sufficient to identify the person responsible for paying the bill may also obtain access rights to Account Management. Except as set forth below, any person with access rights that does not identify himself as the person responsible for paying the bill will be deemed a "Secondary User".

4.2.1 Primary User is Superior to Secondary User, and Responsible for the Whole Account. 

When a Secondary User obtains access rights or is granted access rights by the Primary User, AT&T will provide notification to the person responsible for paying the bill. A Secondary User must establish his own separate AT&T Access ID and password, and understand that he or she may be later removed from online access by the Primary User. Primary User is thus superior to Secondary User for purposes of online access. For certain types of accounts, a Primary User may be able to transfer Primary access rights to a Secondary User and, if no Primary User is designated on the AT&T account, a Secondary User may be able to claim Primary access rights on such AT&T Account. Anyone claiming Primary access automatically becomes obligated for all online account activity as if he or she was the party financially responsible for the entire account, including satisfying orders, paying unpaid invoices, and undergoing credit checks for new service.

Please note: if AT&T creates an AT&T Access ID for you (in cases where you have not established your own AT&T Access ID), you will be automatically designated as the Secondary User and must then claim Primary access rights on such AT&T Account.

Both Primary and Secondary Users can authorize other third parties to act on behalf of the person responsible for paying the bills but only in AT&T owned stores ("Authorized Users"). The person responsible for paying the bill is solely responsible for any access to Account Management or services or any action taken by a Primary User, a Secondary User or an Authorized User. Any action taken on the account by a Secondary User or an Authorized User may result in a credit inquiry. You are responsible for all changes made by such Authorized users or action taken as a result of Secondary Access to your myAT&T account, including, but not limited to, new or extended Services Commitments, and the purchase of Products or Services.

4.2.2 Account-wide Access to Secondary Users. 

Secondary Users will have, with some exceptions, online access to the entire account linked to that Access ID. Primary Users will always have online access to the entire account. All Secondary Users can therefore have no expectation of privacy vis-à-vis the Primary User with regard to any aspect of the account(s).

If You are the Primary User, You agree to advise all Secondary Users that the other Secondary Users may be able to see specifics of the entire account, including data, talk or SMS text usage of others on their account.

If You are a Secondary User, you agree that the Primary User may be able to see some things you cannot see, such as see about your data usage.

4.3 

An AT&T Access ID may no longer provide access to Account Management related to an AT&T service that has been terminated.

4.4 

Use of the myAT&T application shall be subject to the myAT&T End User License Agreement and these Terms.

4.5 

AT&T will maintain a process for forgotten passwords for an AT&T Access ID.

5. AT&T Access ID and Account Management – Term and Termination.
5.1 

These Terms shall be effective until terminated by AT&T, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time and for any or no reason. AT&T may also change, suspend or terminate your access to or use of AT&T Access ID or Account Management for any reason with or without prior notice, including, but not limited to, deactivating, changing, or deleting your AT&T Access ID, password, or Profile Information. Cause for such termination, suspension, or change shall include, but not be limited to, a) breaches or violations of these Terms or other incorporated agreements or guidelines, b) requests by law enforcement or government agencies, c) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), d) discontinuance or material modification to an AT&T service, e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems, f) extended periods of inactivity, or g) engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities. AT&T shall not be required to make your AT&T Access ID Account Management, or any other information or services associated with your AT&T Access ID available to you after any such action is taken. AT&T will not be liable to you or any third party for compensation, indemnity, or damages of any sort as a result of changing, suspending or terminating AT&T Access ID or Account Management in accordance with these Terms. Such action will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy AT&T may have, now or in the future. These obligations survive termination of AT&T Access ID or Account Management.

9. AT&T Access ID and Account Management – Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration.

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

9.1 Summary:

Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 800.288.2020. In the unlikely event that AT&T's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&T will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.

In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&T has offered you to settle the dispute.

9.2 Arbitration Agreement.
9.2.1 

AT&T and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:

Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
Claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Section 9 only, references to "AT&T," "you," "your" and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of this AT&T Access ID and Account Management, or of services or devices under this Agreement or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and AT&T are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

9.2.2 

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to AT&T should be addressed to: Office of Dispute Resolution, AT&T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If AT&T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AT&T may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&T is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at https://www.att.com/arbitration-forms.

9.2.3 

After AT&T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, AT&T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at http://www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at https://www.att.com/arbitration-information.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse AT&T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.

9.2.4 

If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of AT&T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&T will:

9.2.4.1 

pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is greater; and

9.2.4.2 

pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("the attorney premium").

If AT&T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards You any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

9.2.5 

The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in Section 9.2.4 supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&T may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&T agrees that it will not seek such an award.

9.2.6 

The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND AT&T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and AT&T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.

9.2.7 

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) while this Agreement is in effect, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.
