CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS' RIGHTS
The Right to Know, The Right to Delete, and the Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) affords California consumers (1) the right to know what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and/or sell; (2) the right to request that we delete their personal information; and (3) the right to request that we no longer sell their personal information.

If you would like information about the personal information that we collect, disclose, and/or sell about you, or if you would like to make a request for us to delete or to stop selling your personal information, please visit our website at datarights.hilton.com or click the “Personal Data Requests” link at the bottom of any Hilton website to submit your request. You also may call our toll-free telephone number: (800) 413-7470, email the Data Protection Office (“DPO”) at DataProtectionOffice@Hilton.com, send a letter to the Data Protection Office at 7930 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, Virginia, USA 22102, or complete a paper form available from the front desk at any of our hotels. In addition to these methods, California consumers may request that we no longer sell their personal information by clicking here.

When the DPO receives your request, the DPO will first verify your identity. If you are a Hilton Honors member, the DPO will verify your identify by asking you to provide your name, Hilton Honors account number, and the email address and phone number associated with your Hilton Honors account. If you are not a Hilton Honors member, the DPO will verify your identity by asking you to provide your name, the confirmation number from one of your stays at a Hilton property, and the email address associated with that stay. Once the DPO has verified your identity, the DPO will promptly fulfill your request.

If you would like, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent, please submit an order issued by a court, a document submitted by a barred attorney, or a formal certified document issued by an official governmental agency.

If you would like to opt out of the sale of your personal information to behavioral advertising networks, you may do so by clicking on the banner that appears on any Hilton website when you access that site from an IP address that relates to California or by visiting our website at datarights.hilton.com or click the “Personal Data Requests” link at the bottom of any Hilton website to submit your request. Please note that when you opt out of cookies, tags, and pixels, that opt out only pertains to the device and the browser that you are using when you opt out. If you wish to opt out for other devices or browsers, you must opt out again when you are using those devices or browsers.

Direct Marketing Disclosure

California consumers also may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at one of the following addresses: CA_Privacy@Hilton.com or DataProtectionOffice@Hilton.com, send a letter to the Data Protection Office at 7930 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, Virginia, USA 22102. Within thirty days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted to addresses other than the addresses specified in this paragraph.

The Right to Non-Discrimination

The CCPA prohibits a business from treating a consumer differently because the consumer exercised a right conferred on him/her by the CCPA. We welcome you to exercise your rights under the CCPA, and we will not discriminate against you for doing so.

Removal of Content

If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any site where this policy is posted, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information to CA_Privacy@Hilton.com. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.

HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

We take reasonable measures to: (i) protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, and (ii) keep personal information accurate and up-to-date as appropriate.

Hilton employs a robust team of dedicated information security professionals who are responsible for managing Hilton's security program. This team is responsible for, among many other things, monitoring our systems for potential intrusions, responding to potential incidents, supporting property-level information security, regularly reviewing and updating the security controls Hilton uses to protect data, and providing training on Hilton's information security program.

Hilton maintains a payment card industry (“PCI”) compliance program and an Information Technology compliance program. This compliance program generates audit reports concerning the adequacy and effectiveness of Hilton's Technology internal controls, including a PCI Attestation of Compliance signed by an external PCI Qualified Security Assessor and a SSAE16/SOC1 report addressing the Technology general controls over systems that support certain accounting and financial reporting.

We require third parties with whom we share personal information to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of personal information.

We will never ask you to send us confidential personal information or payment card information via email or text message.

In the event of a security incident, Hilton will notify regulators and/or consumers as required by applicable laws and regulations.

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OR TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF PEOPLE AND PROPERTY

Hilton will disclose personal information as required by law. Examples of such disclosures include when countries require Hilton to collect personal data about visitors to properties in that country, when a law enforcement agency serves a valid subpoena on Hilton, and when a civil litigant serves a lawful discovery request on Hilton. Hilton may elect to share personal information with law enforcement or others as necessary to protect the safety and security of people and property, to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain, and to respond to an emergency.

With your consent, we make automated decisions, meaning without human interference, using segmentation and/or your specific personal information to offer you certain benefits based on your characteristics (such as discounted room rates or other special offers based on your geography, behavior, or demographics).
