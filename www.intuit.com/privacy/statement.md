Last Updated: January 10, 2022

See previous Privacy Statements







Introduction and overview

Intuit leverages technology responsibly to power prosperity around the world, and we believe that everyone has a right to privacy. At Intuit, we view privacy as a key part of the value that we deliver to our customers. Intuit’s Data Stewardship Principles were developed to describe Intuit’s values regarding the data our customers entrust to us.

Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role

As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (which we’ll refer to as “Privacy Statement”) to explain how we, Intuit Inc. and the Intuit group companies (collectively “Intuit”, “we” and “us”) collect, use, share or otherwise process information when you interact with us and our offerings, services and experiences, or when businesses provide us with your information. This Privacy Statement is global in nature, meaning that it is applicable to all Intuit websites and offerings, and it describes our privacy practices when we process:

a) Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “Tax Preparation Information”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;

b) Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of the Intuit platform, which is collectively, all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) other than Tax Preparation Information (the “Intuit Platform”); and/or

c) Personal information as necessary to manage, run, improve and develop our business and personalize your experience while interacting with the Intuit Platform.

Intuit determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal information, as described in this Privacy Statement, and therefore acts as ‘data controller’ (or equivalent/similar terms) for purposes recognized by certain data privacy laws. We may share your personal information within the Intuit group companies and conduct processing activities as controllers or joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions about the processing of your personal information, please contact us in the section “How to Contact Us” below.

This Privacy Statement does not apply where Intuit processes personal information as a service provider (or equivalent role under data privacy laws, such as data processor) on behalf of a customer or entity who acts as the data controller, for example, the customers of our professional tax software products. When we act as a service provider, the privacy statement of the relevant data controller and our agreements with such business or entity will govern our processing of such personal information. 

In certain circumstances, there may be more than one data controller processing your information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as a data controller. In these situations, we act as an independent data controller over our processing activities – meaning that we make determinations over how your personal information will be processed independently from the other data controllers. The other data controllers have their own obligations under applicable information privacy laws. Intuit is not responsible for the processing of other data controllers (including our customers) and you should contact them directly for questions on how they process your personal information and for exercising your privacy rights in relation to such processing. 

The Intuit Platform

The Intuit Platform and your information

When we say “platform” we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), we use that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you’re using. This means that, for example, your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, budgets from Mint, contact and purchase history details from Mailchimp, and recommendations from Credit Karma all live together.

The personal information we use in this centralized way is all the information that Intuit knows about you, either because you are an end user of our services or a customer contact (like a subscriber to a customer's email list) whose personal information has been included in the Intuit Platform. It includes information such as your credentials; your name and contact details; payment information; information about your activities, behavior, your interests and preferences (including purchase history with Intuit or if you're a customer contact, our customers); insights about your finances, business or preferences or your contacts; the content you or others place about you in our Platform; and information we have collected about you from third-party sources.

Organizational account information

Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with an organization (such as your employer). If you are granted access to an organization or household account (for example, a business's account in QuickBooks), the owner of the organization or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights; making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll); or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift). If your access rights are amended by the owner or designated administrator, then you may lose access to the information that is in the control of the organization.

Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of an organization’s account may be subject to the organization’s policies, which may be different from this Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other organizations, and you should consider both the organization's policies and whether you are comfortable enabling the organization with access to your information prior to connecting to their services.

Information we collect

Information we receive from you

The personal information that we receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account and the choices that you make, including your privacy settings. Personal information that we receive from you may also depend upon what services, functionalities or experiences you use, your location and applicable law. 

Creating an account. We collect information when you (or your organization) create an account, interact with the Intuit Platform or activate a subscription. Personal information may include your name, address, phone number and email, country, profile photo, billing information (your payment information), usernames and credentials.
When a business provides it. We collect information when a business you interact with provides us with information about you (for example, when you are a customer contact), including information such as your name, email address and telephone number.
Identification information. We collect information to verify your identity, including your name, social security number, social insurance number, driver’s license numbers, government-issued identification details, for example to verify your identity in order to help you file your tax return.
Customer support, product research, training and feedback. We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number and any other personal information you choose to share when you reach out to us for support, give us feedback, participate in optional surveys, subscribe to marketing, attend our events, participate in product research or training or otherwise interact or communicate with us.
Social and community content. We receive content you post on our social media pages and our community pages.
Online behavioral data. We may automatically collect certain information about your use and interactions with our websites, customers’ websites or e-commerce stores, Platform, social media websites, and marketing campaigns that we or our customers organize, including device information (such as your IP address and unique device IDs), page view information and search results, links and if you are a customer contact, whether or not a campaign presented or sent to you using our offerings has been viewed, delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it has bounced or was treated as spam. 
Device information. We may collect information about your device such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses, log information, error messages, device type, and unique device identifiers. For example, we may collect IP addresses from you as part of our sign in and security features. 
Business and financial information. We may receive information about your business, your finances, expenses, invoices, financial statements, details of your financial transactions, payroll details, payment details, tax return details, details about your customers or vendors or employees, income and wage information, and/or investment information.
Third-party service content. We receive information about you when you sign into a third-party service with your account or when you connect your account to a third-party service. For example, you may choose to connect your account with your bank accounts or social media platforms. To sync your financial account information, we must access your financial account information.
Usage information. We may collect information about your usage of the Platform, such as the pages you viewed, the services and features you used or interacted with, your browser type and details about any links or communications with which you interacted.
Location information. Certain features in the Intuit Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion information, or both, if you grant permission to do so in your device settings. For example, if you use our time-tracking service.
Expert advice. The Intuit Platform provides many opportunities for you to connect with live experts, including, for example, accountants or tax preparers. When you interact with these experts, we may receive information about the questions you ask, the details of your accounts and the guidance provided to you.
Camera and contacts. Certain features may have access to your camera and contacts if you grant permission in your device settings.
Information from cookies and other technologies. Intuit and our service providers may use commonly used tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local shared objects and similar technologies (collectively "cookies") to collect information about you (“Cookie Information”) so we can provide the experiences you request, recognize your visit, track your interactions, and improve your and other customers' experience. You have control over some of the information we collect from Cookies and how we use it. For full details on how we use cookies and similar technologies please see our Intuit Cookies Policy. For full details on how we use cookies and similar technologies when you use or interact with our Mailchimp offerings, please also see our Mailchimp Cookie Policy. 
Information stored locally. Some of our web-enabled desktop services and offerings synchronize with the information on your computer. In doing so, we may collect information such as device information, product usage, and error reports. We may also store personal information locally on your device.

Biometric Information

Certain parts of the Intuit Platform make use of biometric personal information (“Biometric Information“). Biometric Information can be subject to additional laws and regulations.

We collect Biometric Information from you when you enroll in our biometric identity program available through certain of our services and automatically as part of our anti-fraud protection, authentication and customer support activities. These identifiers may include facial recognition information, voiceprints and key-stroke information, as well as mathematical representations of your biometric identifier, such as the template maintained for comparison. We use Biometric Information to identify and authenticate you, and for security and similar purposes. We share Biometric Information with third-party service providers who assist with our information technology, security and fraud programs, our professional advisors, and as required by law or regulation. Intuit does not sell your Biometric Information.

When we collect Biometric Information, you will receive a specific notice and consent request at the time of that collection. You are not required to consent to the collection of Biometric Information in order to use our services, although some functionality may not be available if you decline and you may withdraw your consent at any time.

Intuit will retain Biometric Information until the purposes for which it was collected have been satisfied or three years from your or your organizational account manager’s last interaction with Intuit, whichever comes first.

Information provided by others

Our Platform is designed to help you connect with other people and organizations. As a result of those connections, others may be able to input information about you, including business customers using the Intuit Platform. For example, one of Intuit’s customers may share information about you with us in order to use and benefit from the Intuit Platform, such as information relevant to your or other customer contacts’ interactions with a business that is using Mailchimp. You may also be able to input or process information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator of one of our products or use Intuit to manage customer lists. If you input information about others into our platform, you must only do so if you have first provided sufficient notice and received the appropriate rights and permissions to do so, including having an appropriate legal basis for doing so, such as getting advanced written consent, if required by applicable law.

We may also get information about you from others where permitted by applicable law. We protect and process information obtained from those parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. Our sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the Intuit Platform. For example, we receive information from:

Your service providers. If you choose to sync a non-Intuit account/service with your account, we will receive information from that account/service according to your settings with that account/service. For example, if you connect a point of sale application to your account, we may receive details of your business’s sales records.
Supplemental information and identity verification providers. Service providers who help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business and/or supplement the information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your information. For example, we use third-party service providers to validate your mailing address, phone number or provide additional details about your business. These providers may include, for example, your financial institution, telecommunications provider or email provider.
Customer Support providers. Service providers who provide us with information about you or your interaction with the Intuit Platform for troubleshooting purposes. For example, we may obtain support information or technical issues you have raised with these third parties.
Credit bureaus and other third parties. Many of our features rely on information about you that we receive from third parties. For example, in some countries we may offer free credit reports and credit scores we request on your behalf from credit bureau partners, like TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. Our partners may also provide information such as employment or income data, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so that we can give you more personalized recommendations.
Other users. As described above, we may get information about you from other users, such as your accountant, bookkeeper, tax preparer, your spouse, your head of household, your employer or other business customers using the Intuit Platform (e.g. businesses from which you buy products or services, or with which you otherwise interact). We may also collect such information through features like member referral programs.
Risk management, cybersecurity & anti-fraud providers. We may receive information from service providers who help us assess risks associated with our offerings, including to help combat fraud, illegal activity and to help protect your personal information.
Content providers. We may receive information from software providers that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.
Communication providers & social networks. We or our third party service providers may collect information from email providers, communication providers and social networks, including to monitor public discussion about our brands. Where we are legally required, we ask for your permission to collect this information. 
Joint offering partners. We may offer co-branded services or experiences or engage in joint-marketing activities with others, including through our conferences or live events.
Publicly-available and third-party sources. We collect information from publicly available and other third-party sources, such as open government databases.
Government agencies. We receive information from government agencies, including from various tax agencies.

In some cases, if you click through to go to a Platform Partner’s site, you will automatically be sending your personal information to that Platform Partner.

Your information rights and choices

Your rights

At Intuit, we believe that you have rights to information that pertains to you, your household and/or your business. If another person has input or processed information in the Intuit Platform about you or on behalf of you, your family or your business (and we are processing such information as data controller), you may ask to receive a copy of your information, even if you do not have an account with us.

Depending on where you live, you may have certain state- or nation-specific rights with respect to your personal information that we collect and process.

For specific information on what steps you can take to manage your privacy, please see the “Country and Region-Specific Terms” section for your country, below.

Verification

To help protect privacy and the security of your information, you may be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity and/or ownership rights prior to us exercising your data rights. If we are unable to verify your identity or ownership rights to the data, we may not be able to provide you with data rights until you are able to provide us with proper documents.

Information retention

Unless you specifically ask us to delete your personal information, we retain your personal information as long as it is necessary to comply with our data retention requirements and provide you with services and the benefits of the Intuit Platform and successfully run our business. However, even if you request a deletion, we may be required to maintain your information for as long as necessary to:

comply with our legal or regulatory compliance needs (e.g. maintaining records of transactions you have made with us);
to exercise, establish or defend legal claims; and/or
to protect against fraudulent or abusive activity on our service.

This means we may keep different information for different periods. If your account is canceled because you’ve not used it in a long time, we may delete this information straight away.

There may be occasions where we are unable to fully delete, anonymize, or de-identify your information due to technical, legal, regulatory compliance or other operational reasons. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to securely isolate your personal information from any further processing until such time as we are able to delete, anonymize, or de-identify it.

International data transfers

Unless you have provided us with consent to transfer your information, US Tax Preparation Information shall be processed and stored in the United States in accordance with applicable law.

If you were a TurboTax Canada customer before tax year 2013 and we still house any of your tax return(s) for any of those previous years, your Tax Preparation Information for those previous years will continue to remain in Canada except by your express consent.

With the exceptions noted above, you agree and Intuit reserves the right to store and process your personal information in the United States and in any other country where Intuit or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities in accordance with and as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. Some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).

When we transfer, store or process personal information outside of your jurisdiction, we take appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law. We may use contracts or the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or, as may be applicable, the equivalent clauses approved by the UK Government, to help ensure your information is protected. For more information on the transfer safeguards we rely on and where they have been made available please contact us by using the details in the “How to contact us” section below. 

Although not relied on for data transfers, Intuit (excluding Credit Karma) complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland to the United States. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. You can find more information about Intuit’s and Mailchimp’s EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification here and here, respectively.




Security of your personal information

We use physical, technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect your information. However, despite these controls, we cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of your information. You can find out more about how we protect your information and the steps you can take to help protect your information here.

Changes to our Privacy Statements

From time to time we may change or update our Privacy Statement. We reserve the right to make changes or updates at any time. If we make material changes to the way we process your personal information, we will notify you by posting a notice in our platform or on a community post; by sending you a notification; or by other means consistent with applicable law.

You can see when this Privacy Statement was last updated by checking the “last updated” date displayed at the top of this Privacy Statement. Please review this Privacy Statement periodically to stay informed about how Intuit protects your privacy.
