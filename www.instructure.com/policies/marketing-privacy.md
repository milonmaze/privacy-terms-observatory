RIGHTS. You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you. You have the right to request that we rectify or erase your personal data. You also have the right to request that we restrict or block the processing of your personal data. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to receive personal data about you that we store and transmit to another without hindrance from us, including requesting that we provide your personal data directly to another, i.e., a right to data portability; and where we previously obtained your consent, to withdraw consent to processing your personal data.

Please be aware that Instructure may be unable to afford these rights to you under certain circumstances, such as if we are legally prevented from doing so. Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us. To do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.

RETENTION. We will process and store your personal data only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage, or as permitted by law. The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period or for certain marketing data for our services or other products. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or the initiation of a contract.

TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA. Please be aware that the personal data we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location, including the United States. 

When transferring personal data to countries outside the EEA or the UK, we are required to ensure your personal data is adequately protected in the country where it is transferred. We transfer personal data to these countries only when it is subject to safeguards that assure the protection of personal data, such as entering contracts with transferee companies called the “standard contractual clauses” and the “UK addendum,” which require companies outside the EEA or UK to protect your personal data to the same extent as if it had remained in the EEA or UK.

CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE. California residents have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in relation to your personal data. Please visit our California Privacy Notice for more information on how to exercise these rights.

SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS. We may allow you to connect and share information with certain social networking platforms (“Social Networking Platforms”) (e.g., a Facebook application).
