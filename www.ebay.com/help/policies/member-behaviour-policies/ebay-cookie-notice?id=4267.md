1. Information regarding the technologies we use

When you use our Services, we and authorized third party providers make use of cookies and similar technologies (which we will refer to collectively as "cookies"). We make use of two main types of cookies: those which will not be saved on your device or which will only be saved on your device for as long as your browser is active (called session cookies); and those which will be saved on your device for a longer period (called persistent cookies). We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to our cookies.

The cookies used in connection with the Services have various functions:

They may be (technically) necessary for the provision of our Services
They help us to technically enhance our Services (e.g. monitoring of error messages and loading times)
They help us to recognize you so we can improve your user experience (e.g., by saving the font size and data entered into webforms)
They enable us to show you more relevant ads

2. Which service providers do we cooperate with?

Some of our partners use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies to deliver content tailored to your interests, including ads, on and off our properties. This includes using technologies to determine how relevant the ads are for you, which ads have already been shown to you, how often they have been shown, when and where they have been shown and if you have reacted by carrying out an activity – such as clicking on an ad or purchasing an item. For this purpose, data may be combined with data already collected regarding your interests.

Service providers that we cooperate with include Facebook and Google.

4. Do Not Track

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
