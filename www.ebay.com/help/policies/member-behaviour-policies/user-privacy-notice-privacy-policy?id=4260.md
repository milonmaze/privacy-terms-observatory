Learn more about section 4
5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients

We process your personal data for various purposes and based on several different legal bases that allow this processing. For example, we process your personal data to provide and improve our Services, to provide you with a personalized user experience on this website, to contact you about your eBay account and our Services, to provide customer service, to provide you with personalized advertising and marketing communications, and to detect, prevent, mitigate and investigate fraudulent or illegal activity. We also share your information with third parties, including service providers acting on our behalf, for these purposes. In addition, we may share your personal data among eBay Affiliates in order to fulfill our contract with you under the User Agreement and, if applicable, the Payments Terms of Use- opens in new window or tab.

Learn more about section 5
6. Cross-border data transfers  

Some recipients of your personal data are located outside your jurisdiction or have offices in jurisdictions where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your jurisdiction. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.

Learn more about section 6
7. Storage duration and erasure  

Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section 5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.

8. Rights as a data subject  

Subject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data.

12. eBay and AI
Responsible AI

We are committed to developing and using artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly, ensuring that we use AI to enhance the eBay experience and respect the needs of the entire eBay community. To achieve this, we have invested in a robust Responsible AI (RAI) approach at eBay which leverages the RAI principles set out in our RAI Policy- opens in new window or tab. These principles direct the development, deployment, and use of AI at eBay.

Use of AI

We may use AI-powered tools and products for various purposes, including:

To improve and enhance our Services.
To offer you new or enhanced features and products (such as AI-powered listing generation, image background enhancement, and AI assistants).
To make information about listings and services more accessible, such as by offering AI-generated summaries of product reviews.
To offer you a more customized and personalized experience.
To provide you with enhanced customer service, for example, to bring real-time answers to chat, to analyze customer service interactions to improve their quality or to better understand customer pain points, and to help respond to customer queries.
To support fraud detection, and compliance checks, and to detect suspicious activity on our properties.
To analyze data for specific patterns (e.g. for market research purposes).
To support us in our day-to-day work (e.g. to create summaries, to translate text or to generate images).

AI-powered tools and products may involve personal data processing, but this is not necessarily the case. We use both our own AI models and third-party AI models and systems to deliver AI-powered tools and products. If our use of AI involves the processing of personal data, we rely on the legal bases set out in Section 5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients above for the purposes mentioned therein. If we use any AI system that interacts directly with you, we will let you know.

AI development and training

Where permitted under applicable law, we use personal data collected from our users to train, test, validate, and align our own AI models as well as third-party AI models and systems that we use for the purposes outlined in this User Privacy Notice. This may include the personal data set out in Section 4. What personal data we collect and process. We may combine personal data from our users with data from external sources (e.g. from publicly available sources). The use of personal data for AI development and training is based on our legitimate interest to achieve the objectives outlined under "Use of AI" above.

When training, testing, validating, and aligning AI models, we take appropriate steps to mitigate potential privacy impacts (e.g. through filtering, data masking, differential privacy techniques). Where applicable, our steps are based on data protection impact assessments and the legitimate interest assessment that we carry out. These take into account the purpose of the model, the need and suitability of certain training data, as well as measures that can be reasonably taken during training and thereafter.

AI-related individual rights

You have rights with regard to your personal data. See Section 8. Rights as a data subject above for more details. Your rights also include the right to object- opens in new window or tab to our processing of your personal data for AI development and training purposes.
