Our Transparency Report


We strive for transparency and accountability in the actions we take to protect our members, how we handle inquiries for member data, and how we respond to content removal requests. In the six months since our last report, we’ve seen more people than ever coming to LinkedIn to connect, learn new skills, create content, and find jobs. As more people come to LinkedIn, we continue to invest in technology and people to help stop and prevent abuse, and take action on those who misuse the platform to help keep members safe.

Our semi-annual Transparency Report includes both a Community Report and a Government Requests Report.
