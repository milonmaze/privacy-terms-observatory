Our Transparency Report


We strive for transparency and accountability in the actions we take to protect our members, how we handle inquiries for member data, and how we respond to content removal requests. In the six months since our last report, we’ve seen more people than ever before using LinkedIn to share views, opinions, ideas and experiences. We’ve also seen an increase in our efforts to identify and remove abuse, and stop bad actors.


Our semi-annual Transparency Report includes both a Community Report and a Government Requests Report.
