Government Requests Report


This report discusses how we respond to government requests for member data and removal of content. As part of our commitment to a safe, trusted, and professional environment, we provide transparency about government requests for member data and content removal we receive. We believe in free expression and try to minimize the impact of laws that negatively affect constructive, relevant speech.

We respect the laws that apply to us in the countries where we operate. In the U.S., we respond to several types of legal process at the federal, state, and local levels. Most often, we’re responding to search warrants and subpoenas. Outside the U.S., we ask the government that’s requesting information to issue its request properly, for example through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or a form of international process known as a letter rogatory. Sometimes, we’ll make an exception in an emergency. For more information, see our Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines.

We never provide information to a government to fulfill a member data request without first trying to notify the individual member, except when applicable law prohibits us from doing so. We may make exceptions in certain emergencies.

This report covers the six-month period between January 1 and June 30, 2023.

[1] This column was previously labeled "Accounts Impacted", but we changed the name to clarify that it reflects the number of accounts subject to the data requests, and not the number of accounts for which some responsive data was in fact provided.


[2] We started reporting the number of accounts for which at least some data was provided in response to government requests in our January-June 2014 Transparency Report.

[1] U.S. Government Requests for Member Data include all requests received by LinkedIn from the U.S. government except for national security-related requests, such as National Security Letters and requests under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), if any.



[2] Subpoenas may be issued for information that is reasonably relevant to the general subject matter of a pending investigation. They are typically pre-signed by a court clerk and are issued by prosecutors without the involvement of a judge.



[3] Search warrants require the government to demonstrate "probable cause" and are generally issued by a judge. The standard applicable to a search warrant is higher than that applicable to a subpoena.


[4] Court orders vary depending on the circumstances and the issuing court and jurisdiction. Many of the court orders LinkedIn receives are issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), a provision of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). To obtain such an order, the government must demonstrate specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing investigation. This standard is higher than that applicable to subpoenas but lower than that applicable to search warrants.




[5] The "Other" category includes requests that do not fall within any of the above categories. Examples include emergency requests. As indicated in footnote 1, the category does not include national security-related requests.



[6] In our Government Requests Reports prior to July 2019, we reported on National Security Requests, which could include National Security Letters and FISA requests. In the effort to provide more transparency to our members, we now report NLSs and FISA requests separately. Because we are required by law to delay the release of FISA data by 6 months, reported FISA request metrics correspond to the previous reporting period (for example, data for the July-December 2019 period is reported in our January-June 2020 report).
